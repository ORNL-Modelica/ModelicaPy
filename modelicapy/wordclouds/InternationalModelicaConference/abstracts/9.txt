The aim is to introduce system simulation into early design stages of mechatronic systems and to use the same software tools and model libraries that are also used in later stages for dynamic analysis and control design. It seems that the necessity of a control design is one of the main obstacles against the use of conventional dynamic system simulation in early design stages.

The main benefit of backward simulation is that it does not require an implementation of feedback control.  The backward simulation approach is explained using the example of a servo-hydraulic drive. The paper shows that it can help to significantly reduce the energy consumption of this system. It is possible to simulate typical duty cycles of the drive without the need to redesign the control for each change.}

Ever increasing consumer and regulatory demand for improved fuel economy and lower emissions forces the engines and Engine After-Treatment Systems (EATS) to be improved continuously.

The library is based on a mean-value combustion model and the focus lies on modeling the gas exchange with real-time like simulation times; useful for engine optimization and for evaluation of control strategies. The library contains models of the standard engine components such as manifolds; pipe; turbines; compressors; valves; mechanics; etc. Simulation results from Dymola for a 13 L Volvo truck engine demonstrates that the models capture the engine dynamics and has sufficient accuracy to be useful in engine optimization. The model have been calibrated using surface fitting of maps and least-squares estimation of parameters in Matlab; as well as parameter optimization using JModelica and FMI.}

abstract = {This paper describes the architecture and key equations of a library to model proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in Modelica. The motivating goal of this work is to reconcile many of the published models of PEMFCs and combine them in a reconfigurable PEMFC model that is effective for a variety of uses. It is necessary to distill equations from fuel cell literature into forms that at once capture the essence of the physical interactions; are conducive to the physical modularity of the device; work within the constraints and take full advantage of the Modelica language.

Since the behavior of PEMFCs depends on both advection and diffusion; a suitable alternative to the Modelica Fluid library and the stream concept is necessary.  The proposed solution uses a "mixing" scheme based on the exponential of the Peclet numbers for each transport process.  Storage and transport processes are co-located in each subregion of a rectilinear grid-all in the same base model. The Onsager formulation is used; whereby the effort and flow rate are conjugates of the entropy flow rate associated with energy transfer. 

The implementation is modular; it allows species to be enabled indendently for each region.  In addition; the geometric axes may be independently enabled (up to 3D) and shearing (transverse momentum) may be optionally included.  Chemical/electrochemical inteactions are communicated in a fully acausal manner through expandable connectors. 

This paper focuses on the motivation; background; and approach.  Future publications will describe the ongoing work to calibrate; validate; and utilize the model for particular case studies. The library is made available as open source.}

However this intention substantially relies on the provision of reliable data of the infrastructure; on the railway network and its power grid.

This paper gives an overview about the present state of the work. Two hysteresis models have been implemented so far in Modelica and are currently optimised and tested: the rather simple but efficient Tellinen model and the more complex and accurate Preisach model. Utilisation of the Tellinen model together with components of the Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes library is exemplarily shown with transient simulation of a three-phase autotransformer. Additionally; an efficient implementation of the Preisach model is described and a first comparison between the Tellinen and the classical Preisach hystesis model is presented. It is planned to include the developed hysteresis models into the above-mentioned FluxTubes library after their further optimisation and validation with own measurements. These models will especially allow for the estimation of iron losses and for accurate computation of saturation behaviour during Modelica-based design of electromagnetic components and systems. This becomes increasingly important with the growing requirements regarding energy efficiency and mass power densities of such systems.}

However; if speed gets high enough to reach the field weakening range; for both machine the field oriented control has to prescribe a field current sufficient to reduce the field not to exceed the voltage limits of the stator circuit. Especially for the permanent magnet synchronous machine this paper investigates whether it is possible to determine an optimal field current for every operation point to minimize either total current consumption or losses.}

abstract = {Model-based online applications such as soft-sensing; fault detection or model predictive control require representative models. Basing models on physics has the advantage of naturally describing nonlinear processes and potentially describing a wide range of operating conditions. Implementing adaptivity is essential for online use to avoid model performance degradation over time and to compensate for model imperfection. Requirements for identifiability and observability; numerical robustness and computational speed place an upper limit on model complexity.  These considerations motivate that models for online use should be balanced-complexity; physically based with online adaption possible.

Despite potential benefits; the effort required to implement balanced-complexity models; particularly  at large scales; may deter their use. This paper presents techniques used in the design of balanced-complexity models. A Modelica-based approach is chosen to reduce implementation effort by interfacing exported Modelica models with application code by means of the generic interface FMI. The suggested approach is demonstrated by parameter estimation for a process of offshore oil production: a subsea well-manifold-pipeline production system.}

abstract = {Complex multi-disciplinary models in system dynamics are typically composed of subsystems. This modular structure of the model reflects the modular structure of complex engineering systems. In industrial applications; the individual subsystems are often modeled separately in different mono-disciplinary simulation tools. The Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) provides an interface standard for coupling physical models from different domains and addresses problems like export and import of model components in industrial simulation tools (FMI for Model Exchange) and the standardization of co-simulation interfaces in nonlinear system dynamics (FMI for Co-Simulation). In November 2011; the third beta version of FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation v2.0 was released that supports advanced numerical techniques in co-simulation like higher order extrapolation and interpolation of subsystem inputs; step size control including step rejection and Jacobian based linearly implicit stabilization techniques. Well known industrial simulation tools for applied dynamics support Version 1.0 of this standard and plan to support the forthcoming Version 2.0 in the near future; see the "Tools" tab of website http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/ for up-to-date information. The renewed interest in algorithmic and numerical aspects of co-simulation inspired some new investigations on error estimation and stabilization techniques in FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation v2.0 compatible co-simulation environments. The present paper extends recent results from [ArnoldClaussSchierz12] on reliable error estimation and communication step size control in the framework of FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation v2.0. Based on a strict mathematical analysis; we study the asymptotic behaviour of the local error and two error estimates that may be used to adapt the communication step size automatically to the changing solution behaviour during time integration. These theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests for a (linear) quarter car model and provide a basis for future investigations with more complex coupled engineering systems.}

abstract = {This article describes an extension of the OpenModelica Compiler that translates regular Modelica models into a simpler language; called Micro–Modelica (mu–Modelica); that can be understood by the recently developed stand–alone Quantized State Systems (QSS) solvers. These solvers are very efficient when simulating systems with frequent discontinuities. Thus; strongly discontinuous Modelica models can be simulated noticeably faster than with the standard discrete time solvers. The simulation of two discontinuous models is analyzed in order to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed implementation as well as the advantages of using the QSS stand-alone solvers.}

We present an integrated methodology which translates Modelica models to VHDL hardware designs. Our methodology combines well-engineered algorithms from Modelica compilation and high-level synthesis for hardware. We demonstrate its capabilities using the example of a DC motor which was synthesized and implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 device.}

One implementation of Modelica is the open-source platform JModelica.org. It contains the JModelica.org IDE; that provides a text editor for Modelica code; based on the Eclipse platform.

In this paper; we present an implementation of a graphical editor for the JModelica.org IDE. Several challenges with implementing a graphical editor for Modelica are discussed. Among others; the difficulties in rendering Modelica diagrams and how to interact with existing frameworks in Eclipse are brought up.  A method for preserving the formatting of a modified source code file is also presented; which is essential when the model is altered in the graphical editor.

The presented implementation is compared to other open source software (OSS) implementations of Modelica editors.}

However; parallel programming for such architectures is usually non-portable; low-level and error-prone. To make the computational power of new multi-core architectures more easily available to Modelica modelers; we have developed the ParModelica algorithmic language extension to the high-level Modelica modeling language; together with a prototype implementation in the OpenModelica framework. This enables the Modelica modeler to express parallel algorithms directly at the Modelica language level. The generated code is portable between several multi-core architectures since it is based on the OpenCL programming model. The implementation has been evaluated on a benchmark suite containing models with matrix multiplication; Eigen value computation; and stationary heat conduction. Good speedups were obtained for large problem sizes on both multi-core CPUs and GPUs. To our knowledge; this is the first high-performing portable explicit parallel programming extension to Modelica.}

Firstly; the component mode synthesis (CMS) technique is introduced and the Craig-Bampton method is adopted to build the flexible-body model. The general flexible-body model named FlexibleBody is developed based on the standard MultiBody library in Modelica; which describes the small and linear deformation behavior (relative to a local reference frame) of a flexible-body that undergoes large and non-linear global motion. In the model; the modal neutral file (MNF) is introduced as a standard interface to describe the constraint modes. Secondly; the model is used to construct a library of boom system of concrete pump truck and the simulations covering the expanding and folding process are carried out based on both the rigid multibody and the coupled rigid-flexible system models. Finally; the influence to dynamics performance of the boom system is analyzed and the conclusion is drawn. The method in this paper provides an effective approach to build unified model and simulate flexible-body in multi-domain engineering systems.}

The Python interface to OpenModelica – OMPython; is both a tool and a functional library that allows Python users to realize the full capabilities of OpenModelica&#8217;s scripting and simulation environment requiring minimal setup actions. OMPython is designed to combine both simulation and model building. Thus domain experts (people writing the models) and computational engineers (people writing the solver code) can work on one unified tool that is industrially viable for optimization of Modelica models; while offering a flexible platform for algorithm development and research.}

To simulate the thermal processes in production halls; the machines and the room itself have to be modelled in varying detail. To achieve a quite accurate comprehensive model; the individual machines and the room are modelled in different software and then simulated with the co-simulation tool BCVTB. The communication between the individual models requires a lot of preparative work and as can be seen at the end of the paper; it works fine for a fixed communication time step but is not possible with a continuous synchronization for all given software. Still; the possibilities of co-simulation with BCVTB can be found sufficient for the needs of thermal processes which react very slowly and not in time steps of hugely differing dimensions respectively; but require a period of time which can easily be approximated small enough for a certain scenario.}

Using Modelica as the development language for the vehicle model within these systems enables rapid model development and the fast evaluation of vehicle concepts.  This enables more vehicle concepts to be tested before committing to a prototype build.  The use of physical models also ensures that geometry changes and other physical modifications to the concept can be evaluated on the simulator at an early stage.}

We present a modular approach consisting of two parts to handle complexity and increase the performance: a modular library for the different domains and a co-simulation framework. To begin with; coupling aspects as causality and communication are discussed in this context and their implementation is shown. A further focus is the variable macro step size that we developed within the framework for the automotive drive cycle simulation. The results of the modular approach are described and analyzed regarding error and performance aspects. Finally; challenges of the work are mentioned and an outlook; including FMI [2]; [10]; is given.}

abstract = {When translating a model that uses elements from Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody the Modelica Compiler has to deal with a large sparse linear system of equations. The application of Tearing yields a dense linear system usually of size equal to the number of degrees of freedom. Solving such a system for the unknowns requires O(n³) operations. From literature algorithms can be found that are able to solve a mechanical system in only O(n) operations. The way those algorithms have been formulated inhibited the application in a general equation based framework like Modelica. This paper presents a graph theoretical generalization of those O(n) algorithms which has been implemented into the OpenModelica Compiler (OMC). The performance of the new algorithm has been compared to Tearing by looking at several test models.}

abstract = {In this paper a working principle based upon the novel expansion and distributor device EcoFlow(TM) is analyzed. The device enables compensation of flow maldistribution by control of individual channel superheat. The working principle is discontinuous liquid injection (pulsating flow) into each individual channels during a specified cycle time. Moreover; the influence of the injection cycle time is investigated together with an optional secondary flow into the other channels with regards to cooling capacity; overall UA-value and COP.

The results showed spurious fluctuations in pressure when simulating the pulsating flow; thus the dynamic behavior in the mixture two-phase flow model is insufficient to model the discontinuous liquid injection principle. Despite; the fluctuations and imperfections of the model we found that the cycle time should be kept as low as possible and that the optional secondary flow increases performance. Moreover; the paper reports on the applicability of Modelica developed models to analyze and optimize the working principle and design of expansion devices such that Modelica may be used in future development of novel discontinuous expansion devices.}

The library facilitates simulation of the coupled heat and moisture transfer through envelopes and the interaction of envelopes with the interior air. The computation of coupled heat and moisture transfer becomes more and more important for the development of electric vehicles. Due to the lack of waste heat from the combustion engine the heating of a vehicle cabin during winter time becomes a challenge. One way to reduce heat losses through the envelope is to add insulation. However; insulation bears the risk of water accumulation and its performance usually decreases with increased water content. The Indoor Climate Library helps the user to detect such problems early in the product development process and to find remedies.}

To validate the model; three difficult transients were simulated: the islanding (sudden plant disconnection from the grid); flow reversal and zero-flow conditions inside the water heater.  Regarding the islanding scenario; the simulation results are very close to the experimental values measured on site. This transient demonstrates the physical validity of the model at it is fast and challenges the model equations in all operating conditions of the exchanger.}

This paper presents the results of this usecase. Utilizing these standardized interfaces; models from different tools are coupled to build up the overall system for the mechatronic gearshift simulation.  The coupling via FMI for Model Exchange was achieved for control modules from MATLAB/Simulink into the SimulationX powertrain model and secondly for the 1D-multiphysics powertrain from SimulationX into the multibody vehicle in SIMPACK.  Furthermore FMI for Co-Simulation was investigated in a pure SimulationX framework for the powertrain model.  Very promising results have been achieved for modeling as well as for simulation processes and the FMI technology has clearly shown its capability to be applied in the productive simulation process.}

With the rising individual demand for energy as well as the diminishing fossil energy resources; new optimized concepts for energy supply and usage are required. To address these challenges; renewable energy sources; decentralized storage; and electric mobility concepts are matters of rapidly growing importance.

Future building energy systems have to successfully integrate user demands; local renewable energy; storage systems and charging infrastructure; a task requiring extensive scrutinizing. 

Typical questions to the engineer are to compare different system layouts with respect to sustainability; cost; and robustness; or to identify setscrews in an energy system to optimize components and control algorithms. 

This paper describes an approach to solve such questions using simulations with the non-causal language Modelica. Modeling paradigms and examples are shown. Special emphasize is given to the “Green Building” library and its components; bringing major building energy systems and electric vehicles to the same platform.}

The method is applied to a model of a thermal management system for Lithium ion batteries in a hybrid vehicle. In this model some components don not need to be calculated through the complete simulation time and are removed from the model through the variable-structure approach.

Arising optimal control problems are solved by an efficient implementation of the direct multiple shooting method; which is especially suitable for nonlinear and stiff system models. Using co-simulation optimizer; plant and estimator can be coupled to a closed NMPC loop. Several stages of a control design process are supported: from virtual simulation experiments to real plants with prototype NMPC controllers. Energy efficient control of vapor compression cycles is presented as example application of the proposed methods.}

The approach is based on associating clocks to the variable types. Special operators are needed when accessing variables of another clock. This enables clock inference and increased correctness of the code since more extensive checking can be done at compile time.}

In order to simulate this behavior; many different approaches exist but are not fully implemented in a simulation program. One of the problems with these kinds of simulations is the lack of compatibility with existing models. This makes the modeling very time consuming. In this paper; a simple approach is shown that provides a general set of equations which can be used to model both Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian behavior of fluids in the same model in Modelica. Since the implementation is in base models; existing components can easily be used to simulate non Newtonian fluids without sacrificing simulation times.}

For the latter it is important to predict the peak solar irradiance under clear sky condition to calculate maximum possible solar thermal loading. In this paper results of irradiation over surface on ground and over aircraft windows and windshields at cruise altitude are presented. Another model implemented here; calculates the view factor between two or more surfaces. Determination of the long-wave radiant heat exchange between two or more surfaces or heat exchange with a surface itself requires a view factor matrix. There are several analytical solutions available to calculate view factor for simple and known configurations. Many building simulation programs estimate the view factors in a simplified way; especially when complex geometries are involved. The simplified approach may result in high errors of surface temperatures; which can further cause error in energy balance and estimation of comfort level. The purpose of creating this model is to calculate the view factor between complex geometries. The view factor matrices of an enclosed space and geometry with openings on its surfaces are presented in this paper. A sensitivity analysis of a view factor matrix is also presented.}

The optimization of this shifting process is of high interest in respect to fuel consumption and comfort considerations. Moreover; for the model-based calibration of automated transmissions; detailed simulation models of the synchronization system are also necessary. Highly accurate models allow simulation of nonlinear effects having a major influence on the shifting process. Currently; with less detailed models only rough estimations of the shifting process are possible; it has a reduced meaning for the precise calibration.  This paper uses a popular double clutch transmission (DCT) as the research object and presents the detailed hydro-mechanical synchronization model. Firstly; an introduction to the theory of the synchronization is given. Subsequently; a Modelica® based synchronization model consisting of hydro-mechanic actuators and gear shifting synchronizers is presented. Finally; these modules are discussed in detail and evaluated based on different simulations. A comparison with measurement data from a test bench is also included in the end.}

First of all; an algorithm for contact tracking of cylindrical surfaces directed by involutes was rearranged. This algorithm  is "simply" reduced to tracking of two involutes. As a result it turned out that common line normal to these both curves of contacting always coincides  with line of action. This property makes it possible to obtain direct simple  formulae for computations of contact.  In the model under consideration a backlash in gearbox is also taken into  account. This means that lost of contact between teeth is possible when  gearwheels rotating. It is possible then to appear the contact patch for  reversal. After that dynamical reasons can force the mesh process to return to  the former mode of the forward stroke and so fourth. All such scenarios for  modes switching are implemented in the model in a unified manner.  To ensure the mesh reliability an overlapping in time of contacts between teeth pairs is used. This property is also implemented in the dynamical model under description. New contact of the next pair of teeth is formed and starts its motion along the line of action before the old contact will leave this line at point of teeth disengaging.}

abstract = {The high abstraction level of equation-based object-oriented languages (EOO) such as Modelica has the drawback that programming and modeling errors are often hard to find. In this paper we present static and dynamic debugging methods for Modelica models and a debugger prototype that addresses several of those problems. The goal is an integrated debugging framework that combines classical debugging techniques with special techniques for equation-based languages partly based on graph visualization and interaction.  The static transformational debugging functionality addresses the problem that model compilers are optimized so heavily that it is hard to tell the origin of an equation during runtime. This work proposes and implements a prototype of a method that is efficient with less than one percent overhead; yet manages to keep track of all the transformations/operations that the compiler performs on the model. Modelica models often contain functions and algorithm sections with algorithmic code. The fraction of algorithmic code is increasing since Modelica; in addition to equation-based modeling; is also used for embedded system control code as well as symbolic model transformations in applications using the MetaModelica language extension.  Our earlier work in debuggers for the algorithmic subset of Modelica used high-level code instrumentation techniques which are portable but turned out to have too much overhead for large applications. The new dynamic algorithmic code debugger is the first Modelica debugger that can operate without high-level code instrumentation. Instead; it communicates with a low-level C-language symbolic debugger to directly extract information from a running executable; set and remove breakpoints; etc. This is made possible by the new bootstrapped OpenModelica compiler which keeps track of a detailed mapping from the high level Modelica code down to the generated C code compiled to machine code.  The dynamic algorithmic code debugger is operational; supports both standard Modelica data structures and tree/list data structures; and operates efficiently on large applications such as the OpenModelica compiler with more than 100 000 lines of code. Moreover; an integrated debugging approach is proposed that combines static and dynamic debugging.

To our knowledge; this is the first Modelica debugger that supports both transformational and algorithmic code debugging.}

abstract = {Many studies for which simulation is necessary include the presence of control systems. While plenty of Modelica libraries are nowadays available to accurately represent the plant; the same is not so true as for the control elements; since industrial ones are endowed with a number of functionalities -- and often present system- or even vendor-specific peculiarities -- that are not represented by the typical blocks (e.g.; based on transfer functions) offered by the existing libraries. This paper is an attempt to start filling the gap and provide an efficient solution; structured and organised in such a way to be easily understood by control specialists; and to ease information transfer between simulation studies and implementation.}

abstract = {In more electric aircrafts (MEA) the electric power network is important for the reliability. To prevent severe faults it is the key issue to identify the faults in the early stage before a complete failure happens. In this paper an early stage fault detection method using wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA) for a regulated buck DC-DC converter is studied. Specifically; the electrolyte input capacitor is diagnosed. The study was carried out using simulation with Modelica / Dymola. The fault features that were extracted from different levels of MRA decomposition provided clear information for both fast and slow occurring faults. This method showed significant advantages compared with filter technique. It is concluded that wavelet transform is a suitable tool for early stage fault detection of the power electronics in MEA. In addition; the simulation language Modelica provides a convenient possibility for the quick design of fault detection strategy.}

The small wind power plant consists of three wind power units; with a nominal power of 3kW; and one grid connection interconnected with an internal DC-grid. All the controls needed for controlling and optimizing the operation of the individual parts in the plant were developed and implemented. Apart from this a managing control for the entire plant were developed and implemented.

The control was implemented using an external static library interconnected with Dymola. the External Object approach for implementing objects in Modelica was also tested. The optimization algorithms developed for the wind turbine was done in a way so that no measurements of the wind speed are needed. The controls were developed so that they can achieve a number of different tasks such as Reactive Power Compensation and Island Control.

Models were implemented in Modelica using Dymola as tool. In order to model the power electronics involved in the system the Electric Power library (EPL) has been utilized. Models for the wind turbine were developed and tested.  The models were in the end tested and evaluated by running a number of different simulations. The Different test cases consists of optimizing the power output; controlling the power output to a desired level and island operation; that is to power up a small grid on its own.}

In particular; we use composite adjoints; an extension of the classical adjoint sensitivity analysis; and a numerical integrator based a modification of second-order discrete adjoints of the extrapolated linearly-implicit Euler method. Therewith; the 116-by-116-Hessian of the objective function with respect to 116 model parameters can be computed for computational costs equivalent to only less than 18 objective function evaluations; while the computation of the same Hessian by means of the cheapest finite-difference formula would require 6845 objective function evaluations.}

abstract = {Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has become increasingly important for today’s control engineers during the last decade. In order to apply NMPC a nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP) must be solved which needs a high computational effort. 

State-of-the-art solution algorithms are based on multiple shooting or collocation algorithms; which are required to solve the underlying dynamic model formulation. This paper describes a general discretization scheme applied to the dynamic model description which can be further concretized to reproduce the mul-tiple shooting or collocation approach. Furthermore; this approach can be refined to represent a total collocation method in order to solve the underlying NOCP much more efficiently. Further speedup of optimization has been achieved by parallelizing the calculation of model specific parts (e.g. constraints; Jacobians; etc.) and is presented in the coming sections.

The corresponding discretized optimization problem has been solved by the interior optimizer Ipopt. The proposed parallelized algorithms have been tested on different applications. As industrial relevant application an optimal control of a Diesel-Electric power train has been investigated. The modeling and problem description has been done in Optimica and Modelica. The simulation has been performed using OpenModelica. Speedup curves for parallel execution are presented.}

The DyMoRail library allows an efficient simulation of complete train compositions in various combinations. The library contains different car models; buffers; couplers equipped with both friction and elastomer springs; as well as the center-buffers for multiple units. DyMoRail allows to simulate the entire motion cycle that the buffer undergoes during a collision. The robust programming of the basic models allows for arbitrary combination of buffers; couplers and destruction tubes. Different modelling techniques (SIMULINK; STELLA) have been explored. Since the modular structure of Modelica allows fast and simple exchange of rolling stock and different types of couplers and buffers; it was decided to build this library in Modelica. This simulation environment was successfully used by Schwab Verkehrstechnik AG during the development of their state-of the-art center coupler product family. Within DyMoRail2 we intend to implement further features and improve the modularity and flexibility of the library.}

The method may be useful in simulating models of physical systems where the base units of the International System of Units (SI)--the standard unit system in Modelica--are poorly scaled.  It also provides a convenient means to express the values of physical quantities in fields of science and engineering where data is typically represented in other systems of units or constants (i.e.; "natural units").  By explicitly expressing the value of a physical quantity as the product of a number and a unit (where the unit is an algebraic variable); the method uses variables that are unit-neutral. Unfortunately; workarounds are necessary in order to implement the method in the current version of the Modelica language. Nonetheless; it may be useful in special applications; and the related discussion may provide valuable insight. In particular; it is shown that there is an apparent conflict in the interpretation of "number" and "value" between Modelica and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).}

This paper describes the concepts of purely parametric physical models and code generation. It is elucidated how models of different complexity can be transformed into each other by model driven development techniques. Thereby the focus is set on the generation of Modelica code and it is explained how the use of Modelica libraries simplifies the generation of simulatable code. During the development of generators for Modelica; issues arose regarding type compatibility of arrays with different sizes when using polymorphism. These issues are explained by an example and possible enhancements for the Modelica language are suggested.}

abstract = {Representing a physical system with a mathematical model requires knowledge not only about the physical laws governing the dynamics but also about the parameter values of the system. The parameters can sometimes be measured or calculated; however some of them are often difficult or impossible to obtain in these ways. Finding accurate parameter values is crucial for the accuracy of the mathematical model.

Estimating the parameters using optimization algorithms which attempt to minimize the error between the response from the mathematical model and the physical system is a common approach for improving the accuracy of the model.

Optimization algorithms usually require information about the derivatives which may not always be easily available or which may be difficult to compute due to; e.g.; hybrid dynamics. In such cases; derivative-free optimization algorithms offer an alternative for design and parameter optimization.

In this paper; we present an implementation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for parameter estimation in the JModelica.org platform. The implementation allows the underlying dynamic system to be represented as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU); thus enables parameter estimation of models designed in modeling tools following the standardized interface; the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI); such as Dymola.}

abstract = {This paper will discuss Modelica’s unprecedented flexibility for multi-body simulations. Classical multi-body simulation has as a prerequisite constant mass and inertia for deriving the equations of motion for rigid bodies. However; there are industry applications that require time dependency of mass and inertia. In these applications mass and inertia cannot be assumed constant and will thus constitute part of the differential equations system by means of introducing mass and inertia as states.

Introducing mass and inertia as states; rather than parameters; requires reformulation of the Newton/Euler formulation of the body model component in the Modelica mechanics multi-body library [3]. 

A successful new body model formulation has been created and is applied in an industrial example system model.}

abstract = {Aircraft systems have evolved dramatically since the beginning of aviation. Many improvements of performance and safety have been made. Now each sub-system has optimized performance and it is thus difficult to find gains without breakthroughs in architectures or technologies; and this is the objective of the R & D studies towards a more electric aircraft. 

Simulations are widely used to explore and justify systems architectures [1]; but system simulations currently suffer from limitations which make them difficult to use for complex multi-systems analysis. Therefore tools and processes must evolve to accompany these major changes in order to support the designers in their quest of optimized design.

This article deals with new processes and tools which will take part; in a close future; in the determination; the verification and validation of systems architectures. The results presented here were obtained during the CSDL project (Complex Systems Design Lab) partly funded by the French government.}

abstract = {The Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) opens new opportunities for the development and extension of existing non-Modelica simulation programs with Modelica models. For the developer this is a productive way to design and validate new complex simulation models with multi-domain modelling languages such as Modelica. With the standardised Functional Mock-Up Interface and the Functional Mock-Up Unit (FMU) export it is possible to execute these models within other software tools; including information exchange during the simulation. But there are some design requirements in Modelica; which have to be taken into account. Some practical hints and solutions for input and output processing; external initialisation and simulation are presented in this paper. For the implementation of similar more than one FMU (in our case building HVAC (Heating; Ventilation and Air Conditioning) equipment configurations) in existing software; an interface extension plug-in is developed to pick a specific FMU and execute it alongside the existing simulation algorithm. This may require some workarounds for FMI specified functionalities; which are not supported so far by the Modelica simulation environment from which the FMU for co-simulation is exported.}

abstract = {Chemical process models are highly structured. Information on how the hierarchical components are connected helps to solve the model efficiently. The structural information retrieved from the JModelica environment will play an important role in the development of our novel optimization methods. Foundations of a Modelica library for general-purpose chemical process modeling have been built. Multiple steady-states in ideal two-product distillation were computed as a proof of concept. The Modelica source code is available at the project homepage. The issues encountered during modeling may be valuable to the Modelica language designers.}

This methodology allows for parameter synthesis of the industrial automation systems under consideration of customer requirements. Furthermore; the parametrized system can be verified automatically. An integrated system model consisting of requirements; system design and verification models is created and can be used as a design template to generate a new parameter set according to the change of customer requirements. A case study from the practice is presented to proof the concept of this methodology.}
