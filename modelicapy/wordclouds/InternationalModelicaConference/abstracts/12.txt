abstract = {Dynamic process models of the capture unit of a 600 MW combined cycle power plant with post-combustion CO2 capture were developed in the Modelica language. The process models were utilized to understand the transient response of the capture unit when the plant was initially operated at steady-state conditions at different power plant’s loads. Simulations to characterize the open-loop response of main process variables of the process to step-change disturbances in flue gas mass flow rate, solvent circulation mass flow rate and reboiler duty were performed. It was found that the plant was slower when operated at lower loads, i.e., it required longer total stabilization times for the most relevant variables of the process. Simulations revealed that the PCC unit responded significantly faster to an increase in exhaust gas mass flow rate than to a reduction in exhaust gas mas flow rate.}

abstract = {State-of-the-art Modelica implementations may fail in various ways when 
tearing is turned on: Completely incorrect results are returned without 
a warning, or the software fails with an obscure error message, or it 
hangs for several minutes although the problem is solvable in 
milliseconds without tearing. We give three detailed examples and an 
in-depth discussion why such failures are inherent in tearing and cannot 
be fixed within the traditional approach.

Without compromising the advantages of tearing, these issues are 
resolved for the first time with staircase sampling. This is a 
non-tearing method capable of robustly finding all well-separated 
solutions of sparse systems of nonlinear equations without any initial 
guesses. Its robustness is demonstrated on the steady-state simulation 
of a particularly challenging distillation column. This column has three 
solutions, one of which is missed by most methods, including 
problem-specific tearing methods. All three solutions are found with 
staircase sampling.}

The development of large-scale models of human physiology was facilitated by a new generation (i.e. equation-based) simulation environment, especially by Modelica language. These models can be used to explain the causal relations of the pathogenesis of many diseases, they can be applied in the evaluation of clinical trials and they can also be used in the core of sophisticated medical simulators.}

could be further depend on an input parameter like the

This is why crosswind stability is an active field of research within the project Next Generation Train. However, this field relies on the cooperation of two different domains, namely aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics. With this background a crosswind stability tool was implemented in Modelica as a part of the DLR RailwayDynamics Library. This tool gathers data from scaled wind tunnel measurements and multibody data on the railway vehicle in order to rapidly analyze and assess the risk of overturning due to high crosswinds. To a large extent the tool is oriented towards the associated homologation rules and standards. However, the tool is as well supposed to support future advancements of these standards by providing capabilities for the stochastic analysis of the crosswind stability problem.}

abstract = {This paper describes a method for early stage boat design by creating and utilizing a library of naval architecture based boat components in Modelica. The method involves the construction of stand-alone boat components which can be assembled into a simulation model. Structuring the model into multiple system levels provides a clear overview. Utilizing the partial-complete methodology ensures that all system levels are replaceable within the simulation. This allows the user to construct many different boat models and experiment with unconventional or innovative designs. By comparing the performance and behaviour of different assemblies of components the most ideal design for a given purpose can be found and used as a starting point for the in-depth design process. By organizing the components in a library they can be re-used in future projects as well. It is noted that when additional libraries are utilized the effectiveness of this design method increases significantly. As the availability of component models increases, users can save time on the physical design and modelling of the individual components and instead focus on assembling working simulation models right from the beginning. To illustrate this, the construction of a few simple boat components is described in this paper. These components are then combined to simulate multiple concept designs.}

These challenges concern the capability to  couple multiple domain specific simulators, and the FMI standard is an answer to this. But they also concern the scalability and the accuracy of the simulation within an heterogenous system. We propose and implement here the concept of a Matryoshka FMU, i.e.~a first of its kind FMU that encapsulates DACCOSIM -- our distributed and parallel master architecture -- and several FMUs it controls. The Matryoshka automatically adapts its internal time steps to ensure the required accuracy while it is controlled by an external FMU-compliant simulator. We present the JavaFMI tools and the DACCOSIM middleware used in the automatic building process of such Matryoshka FMUs.~This approach is then applied on a real-life Distributed Energy System scenario. In regards of the Modelica system simulated  in Dymola, improvements up to 250% in terms of computational performance are achieved while preserving the simulation accuracy and enhancing its integration capability.}

abstract = {In recent years, co-simulation has become an increasingly industrial tool to simulate Cyber Physical Systems including multi-physics and control, like smart electric grids, since it allows to involve different modeling tools within the same temporal simulation. The challenge now is to integrate in a single calculation scheme very numerous and intensely inter-connected models, and to do it without any loss in model accuracy. This will avoid neglecting fine phenomena or moving away from the basic principle of equation-based modeling.

Offering both a large number of computing cores and a large amount of distributed memory, multi-core PC clusters can address this key issue in order to achieve huge multi-simulations in acceptable time. This paper introduces all our efforts to parallelize and distribute our co-simulation environment based on the FMI for Co-Simulation standard (FMI-CS). At the end of 2016 we succeeded to scale beyond 1000 FMUs and 1000 computing cores on different PC-clusters, including the most recent HPC Infiniband-cluster available at EDF.}

The high-level description of optimization problems using Optimica allows flexible optimization formulations including constraints on physically relevant variables such as supply temperature, flow rate and pressures. The benefit of new algorithms for symbolic elimination in Optimica Compiler Toolkit is also investigated. The framework is applied on a test case, which is based on a planned city district located in Graz, Austria. The results demonstrate the generality of the representation as well as the accuracy of the simplification for dynamic optimization of temperature supply and pressure control.}

Compared to existing methods, the original features of the developed solution are to fully exploit the thermal storage capacity of the network and to determine the best compromise between pumping costs and heat losses. A numerical case study based on a representative DHS is used to evaluate the method over a heating season (5 months). Results show that our method reduces production costs up to 8.3 % when compared to a more classical controller. Moreover, the observed computational costs are compatible with the requirements of the receding time horizon principle, ensuring that the method is tractable on real DHS.}

For a quick resolution of this question, a Modelica model is created.
Model creation is focused on a short development time as well as usefulness for controller synthesis. A workflow is presented that enables a quick iteration time between controller synthesis in Matlab and controller testing in a Modelica environment.

The activity is the result of cooperation between Dallara, responsible for the case study, and Modelon, developers of the libraries used to build the simulation model.}

In this paper, the quasi-1D model of a sonic restrictor is presented, together with its integration in an engine model, in order to investigate the behaviour of the engine power and torque when the choked condition is reached. 
The study shows how power and torque curves are affected when a sonic restrictor is installed within the intake system and outlines the need of detailed simulations in a restricted engine development process, to avoid steep engine power reductions at high speeds.}

Although the model can be used for modelling a wide range of scenarios, this paper concentrates on the application of engine thermal shock test dynamics prediction through coolant and lubricant cycling. An internal combustion engine is load-controlled on a dynamometer. Coolant and lubricant temperature transients are imposed on the engine system. Using freely available and commercial Modelica Libraries within the Dymola environment, the systems integration of the coolant rigs, lubricant rigs and engine is achieved. The rigs and the controllers are validated against test data to create predictive models of such systems for test virtualisation. This allows the user to develop and define control strategies for the tests from desktop, prior to engaging in laboratory tests.}

abstract = {Algorithmic differentiation has proven to be an efficient method for
evaluating derivative information for implementations of mathematical
functions. In the context of the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)
the reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation shows immense promise.

FMI is increasingly used for model-based applications, such as parameter
estimation or optimal control. The paper motivates the exploitation of
algorithmic differentiation and proposes an extension of FMI for the
evaluation of adjoint directional derivatives.

Attempts to interface algorithmic differentiation libraries with Modelica
tools have been made. Instead of generating code for the target language
which is instrumented with algorithmic differentiation library API and then
compiled, in this new approach the intermediate representation used by the
library is generated directly. This avoids compilation of the target language that often
takes a large fraction of the overall simulation time.
It also avoids model execution in order to create such an internal
representation at runtime. The initial results are presented here.}

To generate data for rotating machinery diagnosis, we developed rotating machinery library using Modelica. It provides the basic components such as rotor, shaft, bearing, coupling, housing and support. Its component models are implemented on basis of rotor dynamics theory. This library makes it possible accessing rotating machinery operation data with various faults such as unbalanced rotor, shaft bending and ball bearing faults. To validate our models, we compared both Modelica simulation and experiment with a rotor kit as a test case.}

TSP library is developed by EDF and released under open source license. The library features multi-domain modeling such as thermal-hydraulics, neutronics, combustion, solar radiation, instrumentation and control. 
Numerous organizations and individuals worldwide now use TSP. Until recently, the TSP library could be used only under Dymola for the modeling and simulation of complex power plants. But now, with the latest version of OpenModelica (OM), we can simulate complex models of power plants with complex scenarios.
To be able to use TSP under OM, some adaptations have been applied in our models, essentially the method used to make inverse computation. 
The objective of this work is to evaluate the potentiality, capability and efficiency of using OpenModelica tools to perform dynamic studies of power plants. A combined cycle power plant has been chosen as a representative test case of the complexity of this type of study.
The paper describes the dynamic model of a combined cycle power plant, whose objective is to study a step variation load from 100% to 50% and a full gas turbine trip, using OM software. Also, the structure of the model, the parameterization data, the results of simulation runs, the difficulties encountered using OM and the comparing between Dymola and OM are presented.}

abstract = {District Heating (DH) systems are often seen as a good practical approach to meet the local heat demand of the districts due to its ability to provide affordable and low carbon energy to the consumers. Yet, under today’s regulations to renovate the buildings into more energy-efficient ones, the local heat demand is decreasing. Therefore, the operation of DH systems is also affected by the changing heat demand profile, which might lead to less profits for the operators of DH systems. Thus, the operators of DH systems strive for an optimal operation at which the heat demand is met and the profits are maximized. Due to the fact that these systems are complex-physical systems, therefore it is difficult to conduct any experimental investigation on them in order to examine the optimal operation. Accordingly, it is crucial to create fundamental models to investigate the optimal operation of such systems. In this paper, a power-based model is built to represent the heating station as part of a DH system. Then, the model is validated using real data from an existing heating station in Freiburg, Germany. The validation results reveal that the goodness-of-fit for the model is held to be good enough to test it for operational optimization cases.}

It provides a set of environment models with minimal dependencies, complete compatibility to the Modelica Standard Library, and convenient drag & drop usage. The DLR Environment Library is expected to immensely aid developing end-to-end simulation models integrating components from DLR&#8217;s SpaceSystems and FlightDynamics Libraries. In particular, it will importantly decrease modeling errors due to its consistent environment models.}

To cap-ture the complex relations between the properties of the molecules used and the process conditions, the selection of suitable molecules should be directly integrated into process design. Solving the resulting challenging integrated design problem is enabled by the Continous-Molecular Targeting – Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CoMT-CAMD) approach. Here, the combinatorial complexity of the molecular decisions is avoided by relaxing molecular parameters in a physically-based thermodynamic model. So far, implementations of CoMT-CAMD were based on procedural programming languages. This impedes reusability and the investigation of process variants as well as the design of complex processes. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we implement the CoMT-CAMD approach based on object-oriented process modeling and thus enable the integrated process and molecular design with Modelica. The resulting approach is demonstrated for the design of a process and the working fluid for a geothermal Organic Rankine Cycle application.}

The information from several data sources, which describe the building geometry, the building construction, the building location and the building itself, is used to fill a building data model. This intermediate data structure is still independent of a certain building simulation tool. 
A new developed tool for template based code generation (CoTeTo) uses the building data model and combines it with a set of different code generators, which are able to generate Modelica building models with a different level of detail: Strong simplified low-order building models for district energy simulation with a large population of buildings, more advanced multi-zone building models for building energy simulation and 3D space resolved room models for a detailed indoor climate analysis.
Three case studies for the mentioned building model types demonstrate the code generation approach.}

This requires additional arrangements in order to reach the performance of a state-of-the-art conventional vehicle. This paper presents a possible design solution. The wheel carrier is split into two parts, thus enabling to tune the frequency response correspondingly to reference vehicles. Besides the technical solution the Modelica modeling of the proposed suspension system as well as a vehicle dynamics and ride comfort assessment are presented.}

Parameter estimation and optimization is a powerful tool in many engineering and science fields. Nevertheless, the effort and time that must be devoted to coupling and integrating complex modeling languages and tools together with analysis and optimization methods and algorithms sometimes is high. As a consequence of that, commonly the most convenient and easy-to-use optimization mechanisms are applied. Therefore, the focus on the development of this tool is in facilitating such coupling while being customizable. The main toolkit and libraries used in the development of the tool are presented, all of them are open source. Two application examples are also presented, one of them is a parameter optimization study considering a steady state model, while the other is a parameter estimation study of a dynamic model against experimental data. Finally, current tool limitations are presented, ongoing work and ideas for future features are also commented.}

abstract = {A Modelica model for the simulation of heat pumps is presented. The model uses a simplified vapor compression cycle with only five refrigerant states. Parameters to the model are evaluated using an optimization procedure to minimize the differences between the model predicted heating capacities and power input and those provided in the manufacturer technical data. The optimization process is done from a Python implementation of the heat pump model.
The model is first tested by verifying that calibration from performance data generated by the heat pump model results in the same parameters as the ones used in the generation of the performance data. In the presented example, calibrated parameters were found close to the original parameters used to generate the data, except for the evaporator heat transfer coefficient for which the model was found not to be very sensitive. In a second example, the model is calibrated against manufacturer data. The heating capacities and power input calculated from the calibrated model are within 2.7% and 4.7% of the manufacturer data, respectively. Finally, the computational performance of the model is tested in a system simulation of a hydronic heating system. The simulation using the presented heat pump model was executed in 152 seconds, compared to 140 seconds for the same system using a simple boiler model.}

by exploiting the predictive character of the optimizationbased

adjoint equations formulated for the discretized equations
being the result of the numerical integration of system
equations by an implicit Runge–Kutta method; 2) initialization
for higher index DAEs is performed with the help
of Pantelides’ algorithm; 3) it does not require the system
to be transformed to ODEs (through differentiation of
some algebraic equations).
The paper presents numerical examples related to hybrid
systems described by index three DAEs, showing the
validity of the proposed approach. All software components

abstract = {This paper presents an application of coupling Modelica under Dymola and JADE to test novel agent-based control for office spaces. The office space with a coupled energy system and weather boundary conditions are modeled in Dymola. The agent platform is programmed in JADE, where the agents communicate with each other to control the technical equipment used to deliver thermal energy to the room. Heating experiments, run for a one room scenario, using a radiator, show better system reaction to the comfort desires of the user when compared to a control with a thermostatic valve, while having similar energy consumption. While the agents run in real time, the simulation in Dymola runs more quickly. We focus on the particularities of the connection for co-simulation to insure smooth transferability of the experiments from simulation to field test, where the energy system as well as the agent platform would be running in real time.}

Design framework consists of modeler, simulation, and performance index calculation module. The modeler has been developed based on Excel for the general designers with no idea of the vehicle dynamics to easily use the commercial vehicle model library that has the hierarchical structure. The model library with hierarchical structure was created based upon Modelica, and developed in order to interlock the model factors and design factors between hierarchs to fit design process. Simulation module is a module that automatically makes a simulation with the model created in modeler module if a user defines a scenario. Lastly, performance index calculation module is a module that makes the result of simulation into performance index. To check the effectiveness of the developed framework, we applied it to the design matters of suspension system in the consideration of the performance improvement of R&H. We confirmed from the result of design that performance enhanced by 15% and time for design decreased more than 50% as well. These results indicate that the developed framework is suitable for the design process for suspension system of target cascading.}

The main purpose is to investigate the dynamic response of the bicycle and its modes of vibration, referring in particular to shimmy. This phenomenon occurs at high speeds and consists of sudden oscillations of the front assembly around the steering axis. Lateral accelerations on the horizontal tube of the frame can reach 5-10 g with a frequency that varies between 5-10 Hz. Even if it is quite uncommon, shimmy is a topic of great relevance, because it may be extremely dangerous for the rider. Thanks to this model, we can show that the main elements which contribute to the rise of the oscillations are the lateral compliance of the frame and the tyres’ deformation.}

All equations are at least twice continuously differentiable with respect to all model variables and can be used in dynamic optimization problems solved by efficient derivative-based algorithms. The accuracy has been verified against the industry standard IAPWS 97 and performance and robustness has been tested by solving a trajectory optimization problem where the start-up time of a gas power plant has been minimized while satisfying constraints on temperature gradients, pressure and flows. Simulations of various plant models have also been performed to verify and benchmark the implementation. The results show that the new media can be used in both solving dynamic optimization and simulation problems yielding reliable results. The new media has been integrated into Modelon’s Thermal Power library 1.13.}

abstract = {Closed loop two phase thermosiphons have a wide range of applications due to their simplicity, reliability, low cost and the ability of dissipating high heat fluxes from minimal temperature differences. The present study focuses on one thermosiphon operation which solidifies a phase change material (PCM) based thermal battery for a portable air conditioner called Roving Comforter (RoCo). RoCo uses vapor compression cycle (VCC) to deliver cooling and stores the heat released from the condenser into a compact phase change material (PCM) based thermal battery. Before its next cooling operation, the PCM needs to be re-solidified. This is achieved by the thermosiphon, which operates within the same refrigerant circuitry with the help of a pair of valves. The molten PCM which acts as heat source affects the dynamics of the thermosiphon which in turn affects the solidification process. Thus the dynamics of both the PCM and thermosiphon are coupled. For accurate transient modeling of this process, the PCM model considers the solidification over a temperature range, variable effects of conduction and natural convection during the phase change and variable amounts of heat release at different temperatures within the temperature range of phase change. The paper discusses component modeling for this transient operation of thermosiphon and its validation with experimental data.}

A simulation model of a reference hydropower station

scenario of full shut-down and pressure rise in the pressure
shaft due to the water hammer effect. This paper will show

Modia is based on Julia, a powerful programming language with strong focus on scientific computing, meta-programming and just-in-time compilation that allows very fast development. The modeling language is directly defined and implemented with Julia’s meta-programming constructs and is designed tightly together with the symbolic and numeric algorithms.

  few such tools that cater to making it easy to create scientific and
  engineering content.

  In this paper, we will present a platform which can be thought of as
  a content management system for scientific and engineering content.
  We will start by describing what we believe to be the fundamental
  requirements for such a system.  From there, we will discuss two
  different applications built on this platform.  The first is an
  interactive tutorial for teaching the basics of the Modelica
  languages and the other is an example application that involves
  creating interactive content for use in an engineering course on
  hydro-electric power generation.  This content will be published on
  the modelica.university domain and we invite others to
  contribute additional content to the site.}

abstract = {In this paper, an efficient approach for the modelling and simulation of slender beams subject to heavy inertial loads is presented. The limitations imposed by a linear formulation of elasticity are overcome by a second order expansion of the displacement field, based on a geometrical exact beam model. In light of this, the nonlinearities of the elastic terms are shifted as inertial contributions, which yields an expression of the equations of motion in closed form. Thanks to the formulation in closed form, the proposed model is implemented in Modelica, with particular care to the suitability of the model with respect to the Modelica Multibody library.
After describing the model formulation and implementation, the paper presents some simulation results, in order to validate the model with respect to benchmarks, widely adopted in literature.}

abstract = {The paper&#8217;s primary goal is to develop a mathematical
model that could be used towards the development and
improvement of orthotic assist gloves. The model is
constructed using component based modeling in the
object-oriented declarative language Modelica,
specifically the MultiBody Modelica library. Multiple
hand models currently do exist; however, they are
mainly causal, and require separate development and
validation of mathematical solvers before use. By using
Modelica, the model is constructed from the system’s
physical equations, thereby relieving issues regarding
validity of the model’s computational equations; the
acausality inherent in Modelica allows for more model
development that more closely mirrors relations in the
physical world. The model is scoped to be able to model
the kinematics and dynamics of the hand when grasping
a spherical object – both bone structure and muscle
geometry and actuation are simplifications based off
anatomy literature. The contact model is developed as a
separate component from the hand system. The main
design goal of the contact model is to represent the
characteristics of a relatively rigid object that still
maintains a degree of friction and pliability on the
surface layer.
The main two grasps tested in the paper are the
prehensile and precision grasps (powerful and dexterous
grasps). The muscle actuation profiles per each finger
are adjusted until the desired dynamic profile is
achieved for each type of grasp. The main data points of
interests are the joint angles and contact forces for each
finger. Further validation of the model is done using the
animation automatically generated by the tool. Testing
results indicate that the model can successfully simulate
contractions at all levels of abstraction of the hand’s
components (basic bone-joint components, finger
components, and the overall hand system). The results
also indicate that both prehensile and precision grasps
are possible, given appropriate muscle actuation and
finger orientation parameter values.}

Indeed, the development of electric and hybrid vehicles put a focus on the HVAC, this high-consuming auxiliary, which can dramatically decrease the vehicle electric range. Thus, this paper presents a detailed transient and mono-zonal model of a car cabin in order to predict the thermal needs. The model is developed using the MODELICA language via the DYMOLA environment. It considers conduction, convection, radiation heat transfers as well as the HVAC and water vapor impacts. The different assumptions of the model are discussed and important considerations usually not discussed are pointed out. The thermal loads are analyzed. Finally, the heating and cooling thermal needs are computed for steady state mode and for convergence mode as well as for varying recirculation ratios. This work is useful to better understand what is behind cabin thermal needs.}

It is a miniature heat pump system mounted on a robotic platform capable of autonomously following individuals to deliver comfort by directing hot or cold air through automatically controlled nozzles. This allows buildings to relax their thermostats upto 4 degrees Fahrenheit without sacrificing occupant comfort, leading to energy savings anywhere between 10 to 30% depending on climatic conditions. RoCo, a portable device, operates fully on an onboard battery pack which therefore has to be carefully designed to balance power output, operating time and weight. To address this challenge, a multi-physics model that is capable of simultaneously simulating thermodynamics, electricity and mechanics of RoCo is developed and two duty cycles are analyzed. By observing and analyzing the simulation results, control strategies related to RoCo operation are proposed.}

abstract = {The amount of energy used for heating and cooling in the building sector is about one third of the total energy consumed in the world. The finiteness of natural energy resources on the one hand, and the ever-increasing demand for energy in the world on the other hand, necessitate the development of systematic approaches for improving the efficiency of building energy systems as well as minimizing the usage of primary energy resources and the damaging impacts on the environment. Attempts to tackle these problems have led to modern complex energy concepts for buildings, which have consequently initiated a need for new control strategies for them. Multi-agent control, which is known with other names like agent-based control, offers a promising solution to these challenges. To the knowledge of the authors, there are 96 platforms in different programming languages available, which are mostly java-based and mainly used in logistic applications, but there is no platform in the modeling language Modelica, which is widely used for simulation of dynamic systems, especially buildings performance simulation. This lack motivated the authors to develop a platform for agent-based control of HAVC systems. The platform eliminates the dependency of models developed in Modelica on an extra interface, which is usually required to couple the models to the platforms written in any programming languages other than Modelica. This paper presents the structure of the platform and explains how the agents&#8217; communications work. The flexibility of the optimization objective is ensured through the definition of readily interchangeable cost functions. The applicability and functionality of the platform are proved by applying the platform in the control of building energy systems examples.}

In this paper we present the Modelica Vector Graphics Editor (MoVE), a standalone open source editor for Modelica&#8217;s vector graphics syntax that provides many convenience features inspired by the vector graphics editor Inkscape. These features include grouping, snap to grid, move to foreground/background, rotation handles, and drawing perfect circles and squares as well as horizontal and vertical lines when holding Shift.

We hope that MoVE, as a part of the Modelica Tool Ensemble (MoTE), can enrich the open source ecosystem of Modelica by simplifying the creation of more elaborate vector graphics icons for Modelica models.}

Based on the simple HTML communication protocol, editor plugins for a software developer&#8217;s favourite text editor can be developed easily, hence turning any editor into a lightweight Modelica development tool.

We also present a first implementation of a plugin for the text editor Atom that exhibits features necessary for efficient software development, such as display of compile errors, code completion, go to declaration or view of context-sensitive documentation. In addition, Modelica-specific checking of the number of equations in a model is supported.}

abstract = {A common situation in industry is that a system model is composed of several sub-models which may have been developed using different tools. The quality and effectiveness of large scale system modeling heavily depends on the underlying tools used for different phases of the development lifecycle. Available modeling and simulation tools support different operations on models, such as model creation, model simulation, FMU export, model checking, and code generation. Seamless tracing of the requirements and associating them with the models and the simulation results in the context of different modeling tools is becoming increasingly important. This can be used to support several activities such as impact analysis, component reuse, verification, and validation. However, due to the lack of interoperability between tools it is often difficult to use such tools in combination. Recently, the OSLC specification has emerged for integrating different lifecycle tools using linked data. In this paper we present new work on traceability support in OpenModelica where the traceability information is exchanged with other lifecycle tools through a standardized interface and format using OSLC. In particular, OpenModelica supports automatic recording and tracing of modeling activities such as creation, modification, and destruction of models, import model description XML, export of FMUs, and creation of simulation results.}

abstract = {The paper proposes an extension of FMI 2.0 for the rigorous treatment of discrete-time models. This includes the introduction of discrete-time states, the declaration of clocks in the model description and an extension of the calling interface for the external activation of clocks by an importing environment.

The synchronous discrete-time extension enables for the first time the synchronization of FMUs with the environment and with other FMUs. It specializes the existing generic event mechanism of FMI 2.0 and maps to synchronous features of Modelica.

Discrete-time FMUs are needed for the generation of controller code from functional models. This paper outlines different use cases, including a simple PI controller, feed forward control with a nonlinear inverse model and nonlinear model predictive control.

The FMI change proposal FCP-001 and the Modelica change proposal MCP-0024 describe the proposed extensions in more detail. Test implementations exist in the simulation tools Dymola and OpenModelica and in the importing optimization solver HQP. The use cases given in this paper served for further refinement of the change proposals and the test implementations.}

The work explores the annual performance of a plant by studying the effect of the variables of the process by means of Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI), temperature, pressure and degree of oxidation affects the annual production of hydrogen.
The model reproduces the behaviour of a thermochemical receiver-reactor exposed to solar radiation accounting of the thermal inertia of CeO2 which is significantly high
to accomplish the oxidation without extracting the heat of reaction. The operation is optimized to obtain the maximum amount of hydrogen in a year by only modifying the
mass flow rates at the inlet of the reactors. This characteristic demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the model that could be further improved to obtain a constant production of hydrogen.}

We conduct a numerical simulation of the rover using a controller including the identified longitudinal force model. It is shown that when the rover follows a straight line on a plane, the longitudinal force model identified using known soil parameters has sufficient accuracy
on the wheel response based on terramechanics and could be used as a control model.}

Specifically the paper will show that Dymola can generate embedded C-code designed to be easy to embed, with care about minimal foot-print, traceability, and straightforward integration in embedded platforms.

The paper will focus on using Rosenbrock methods for index-1 problems (instead of the normal transformation to index-0) that allows Dymola to handle stiff systems in a way that both is theoretically sound and has an upper bound on the execution time per sample.

The stiff systems in the control system often occur due to using an inverse (simplified) model of the real plant in the controller, and the paper will also propose to extend Modelica making it more straightforward to construct an inverse model of the plant in the controller.}

One facet of this complexity is the integration of multiple software modeling tools and environments in order to utilize the most capable computational technologies for the different features of these complex system models. Physical plant models may be developed in Modelica and require variable step solvers to capture both fast and slow continuum dynamics while discrete time-based control systems may be developed in C-code or Simulink and require fixed time step solvers. Integrating these plant and control models into a single environment can result in computational inefficiencies due to conflicting solver time step requirements.  This paper will discuss the integrated modeling of an automotive vapor compression air conditioning system and associated control systems over a dynamic drive cycle, and the associated numerical performance issues discovered, as well as some approaches taken to increase said performance.}

The FMI cross check infrastructure was created to support tool vendors in their quest for quality improvements and to give users some measure of confidence in the tool quality. Currently it is up to the tool vendors which FMUs to submit there and therefore the features tested in the FMI cross check is incomplete and interpretation of failures is difficult. While for FMI export there is the FMU compliance checker to test a wide variety of FMI features, no means are available today to prove standard compliance for FMI import. This will be overcome by adding reference FMUs to the FMI cross check, testing specific features of the FMI standard for standard compliance and giving detailed feedback, if an importing tool violates the standard. The paper describes the realization and the importance of reference FMUs.}

In this paper, model-based development of an integrated control of the front steering angle and torque vectoring differential (TVD) gear system is described. New integrated control logic was developed using model matching control to let the vehicle yaw rate and vehicle slip angle follow the desired dynamics. Simulation results using a single track model of vehicle dynamics are shown to prove the efficacy of the proposed control. Though, full vehicle model considering all of vehicle dynamics and drive train motion using Modelica clarified the problem of this method in actual cases. Difference between single track model and full vehicle model was compared to estimate the reason of the problem}

The models are therefore complementary, since the economic 1D models can serve effectively in design exploration and optimization, while their sophisticated 3D counterparts can serve in final design validation.

The use of models for evaluation of new concepts or stimulating the unit-under-test (in HiL testing), already firmly rooted in the development process of software functions, will not be sufficient to realize visions like autonomous driving or update-over-the-air. One key enabler for such technologies is virtual validation, i.e. the validation or release of software functions in a pure virtual setup. That is, simulation is not only a tool to shorten the development cycle, but one of the key technologies to release future software functions, e.g. highly automated or autonomous driving. 
In this contribution a feasibility study for the validation of FMI-based virtual ECUs (vECUs) in a co-simulation setup is presented. Thereby, the powertrain and the vECU are represented by FMUs, while the tool CarMaker is used for vehicle dynamics. On the base of the gained experience requirements for the FMI standard are formulated that would allow to go for virtual validation of future software functions.}

abstract = {In order to stay competitive the requirements on machinery in the producing industry have enormously increased. Within the automation industry these demands, like higher throughput or better energy efficiency, result in increasing complexity of the installed plants. Additionally, Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things continuously increase the amount of software. Using model-based development methods is one approach to deal with this complexity. But model-based methods can also be utilized during the operational phase of a plant in order to generate additional value for the plant operator. Introducing smart services based on the usage of physical models enables new control and diagnosis features, e.g. the utilization of inverse plant models for feedforward control or comparing the output of a model with measurements of the plant in order to prove for correct behavior. For all these services the accuracy of the considered models is crucial. With an inexact model neither the future behavior can be foreseen nor the control quality can be improved. The used models don&#8217;t have to be built up from scratch, existing models already created for sizing can be reused. However, these models cannot be used directly. First a reparametrization is necessary, because effects like friction or manufacturing tolerances cannot be taken into account correctly during sizing. For this special kind of problem dedicated optimization algorithms are available for parameter estimation, which take randomly distributed measurement errors and the special structure of this problem class into account. 
In this paper a work flow for parameter estimation based on open source tools is presented, in which the considered models are provided as Functional Mock-up Unit. Afterwards the performance of this work flow is demonstrated on a real industrial problem: A three arm Delta Robot.}

abstract = {The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) specification provides a simple yet effective definition for co-simulation APIs. Even though the number of simulation tools supporting the export of Functional Mock-up Units (FMU) is growing steadily, there is a considerable number of well-established tools that do not. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a generic and adaptable way of coupling established simulation tools in an FMI-compliant manner. The proposed concept has been implemented as part of the FMI++ library, which is used as basis for FMI-compliant wrappers for the TRNSYS simulation tool and the MATLAB environment. These examples demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to include well-established simulation tools with minimal effort. This not only enables researchers and engineers to include a diverse range of tools more easily into their work flow, but is also an incentive for tool developers to provide FMI-compliant wrappers.}

abstract = {High accuracy predictions of aerodynamic forces using computational fluid dynamics requires accurate geometry. The aerodynamic forces on the vehicle body affects the vehicle posture or the vehicle position with respect to ground. When a vehicle is cruising, the change in vehicle posture is usually relatively small with respect to the size of a vehicle. However, these small changes in geometry can lead to significant correlation differences in drag and airflow structure. To address this issue, a coupled simulation approach was developed to predict vehicle posture in typical cruise and wind tunnel test conditions. This coupled approach was tested using PowerFLOW and Modelon’s Vehicle Dynamics Library (VDL). In this approach, the aerodynamic forces on the body are used to calculate the movement of the body and geometry. This modified geometry is then used to recalculate the operating aerodynamic forces. The modified geometry shows changes in total force, the distribution of forces, and the structure of the airflow over the vehicle. The results provided by correct geometry under load conditions offer better correlation to test and provide car makers with the improved accuracy to confidently improve real world fuel economy.}

abstract = {Multizone models are widely used in building airflow and energy performance simulations because they are often suitable for the analysis needed, and due to their fast computation speed.However, the results provided by the multizone
models are sometimes limited due to the underlying well-mixed assumption of the air in a zone (e.g., a room). For zones where this assumption is not suitable, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models may be needed. This paper proposes a coupled simulation model between the multizone and CFD models. The model allows the simulation of a dynamic interaction between airflow and Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems for buildings with stratified airflow
distribution in some of the zones. The approach is implemented using Modelica and its buildings library. In this presenation, we first discuss the
design and implementation of a data synchronization strategy between the two
models. We then show a possible validation of the implementation by comparing the simulated results with experimental data from previous research. Finally, we perform a case study by linking a Variable Air Volume (VAV) terminal box to the space in order to evaluate the capability of the coupled simulation. Finally,
further research needs are discussed at the end of the paper.}

First, we describe the generation process of the building FMU from our stand-alone building simulation program NANDRAD and sketch out internal algorithms for FMI version 2 capabilities. Then, coupling scenarios are described and physical interface conventions are presented. Usability is addressed by automatic generation of building-model specific adapters and wrappers. The building FMU and plant FMUs are then simulated together using different Co-Simulation master algorithms. Finally, based on simulation results and performance analysis we conclude with recommendations on suitable master algorithm options and specific features of suitable building FMUs.}

Although, automotive industry mainly initiated the FMI development, it can extensively benefit building simulation, too.
This paper describes four completely different applications of FMI in the building simulation environment which even extend the basic idea of simple model exchange. This includes the description of developed models as well as additionally required software components implementing the FMI standard.}

As far as specialized tools support the FMI simulator coupling becomes an important option to simulate complex building models. Co-simulation needs a master algorithm which controls the communication time steps as well as the signal exchange between FMUs. Often a constant communication step size is applied chosen by the user. The Richardson extrapolation approach allows variable master step sizes. An extension of this approach is presented, and the method is applied to both academic test examples as well as examples of building simulation which co-simulate FMUs from NANDRAD and SimulationX. Richardson extrapolation turns out to guarantee finding an appropriate step size at the prize of downgraded performance.}

  for steady state and dynamic simulation, lacks good chemical

  Only slow speeds could be achieved through a Python-C API based
  interface connecting OpenModelica with the thermodynamic library.  A
  socket programming based interface helps achieve faster speeds.
  Best results have been achieved by porting the thermodynamic library
  and the calculation routines to OpenModelica, due to two reasons:
  (1) thermodynamic equations are solved simultaneously with mass and
  energy balances (2) overheads in calling the external routines of
  DWSIM are eliminated.  Performances of the above mentioned three
  approaches have been validated with steady state and dynamic
  simulations.  Benzene - toluene separation, methanol - ethanol -
  water distillation, and steam distillation of an n-octane - n-decane
  mixture, have been carried out through these simulations.  This work
  makes available a powerful simulation platform to the chemical
