abstract = {For hotels located in the tropical climate, a significant amount of energy is attributed to the space cooling and the domestic hot water (DHW) usage. To improve the energy efficiency of hotels in the tropical climate, we proposed a heat recovery system that could utilize the waste heat from the space cooling to preheat the city water supplied to the DHW system . To support the system design, we selected Modelica to model the heat recovery system and its control, which is difficult to be simulated by conventional building simulation tools. The Modelica Buildings library  and the Modelica_StateGraph2 library  were employed to build the system model. A hotel in Miami, USA, was selected for the case study. The simulation results showed that the proposed heat recovery system could save up to around 30% boiler energy use in the DHW system.}

In this paper, we describe how we designed, validated and used a library of fast, precise and robust components for district heating systems.

higher index differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) arise.
Since an attempt to solve higher-index DAEs directly
yields several numerical problems, a regularization in combination with a robust and 
 efficient integration is required. 
\qualidaes\ is a DAE solver designed to make explicit use of such a regularization.
It allows for the solution of over-determined quasi-linear DAEs of the form 
$M(x,t)\dot{x}=f(x,t)$, $0=g(x,t)$. 
Such DAEs arise naturally if a quasi-linear DAE is regularized by augmentation with the set of its (hidden) constraints. 
General DAEs can be brought into the quasi-linear form. 
To this end, \modelica\ equations can be transformed into the specific input format expected by \qualidaes. 
This transformation can be implemented in a functional style and yields a non-trivial result.
Additionally it provides an on-the-fly solution for the occurrence of higher-order derivatives.}

abstract = {Most dynamic systems with a basis in nature can be described using Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE), and hence be modelled using the modelling language Modelica. However, the concept of DAEs can still be generalised, when differential operators of non-integer order are considered. These so called fractional order systems have counterparts in naturally occuring systems, for instance in electrochemistry and viscoelasticity.
This paper presents an implementation of approximate fractional-order differential operators in Modelica, increasing the scope of systems that can be described in a meaningful way. Properties of fractional-order systems are discussed and some approximation methods are presented. An implementation in Modelica is proposed for the first time. Several testing procedures and their results are displayed. The work is then illustrated by the application of the model to several physically motivated examples. A possible usability-enhancement using the concept of "Calling Blocks as functions" is suggested.}

Given the growing concern for polluting emissions, it is necessary to investigate a way to improve the vehicle global efficiency and thus close the emissions and fuel consumption gap. A solution is to pre-warm the gearbox in order to make it work at optimal temperature to get the best efficiency possible. Indeed, low lubricant temperature is a source of low vehicle performance due to the viscosity exponentially rising at very low temperature.
Using the Powertrain Dynamics library, a vehicle model with a detailed equation based gearbox model taking into account the temperature-dependent losses is developed.}

abstract = {Modelica 3.3 introduced dedicated built-in language support for state machines that was inspired by semantics known from Statechart and mode automata formalisms. The specification describes the semantics of these constructs in terms of data-flow equations that allows to relate it to the Modelica DAE representation which is the conceptual intermediate format of Modelica code after instance creation (flattening). However, a complete transformation of state machine constructs into data-flow equations at the stage of flattening requires an early commitment to implementation details that potentially hinders model optimizations at subsequent translation phases. Also, due to the required substantial model transformation the semantic distance between the original source model and the flattened representation is rather large. Hence, this paper proposes a more versatile symbolic representation for flattened state machine constructs that preserves the state machine&#8217;s composition structure and allows postponing optimizations to subsequent compiler phases.}

abstract = {Large and highly-detailed Modelica models are frequently
modeled by utilizing repeated structures, which
is a repetition of various elements that are linked together
in an iterative manner. While the Modelica language
standard supports the representation of repeated structures,
it is still not clear how repeated structures can be
handled efficiently during model compilation. Instead of
preserving the compact notation from the model, all repeated
equations are flattened and all array variables are
expanded. This leads to unnecessary long compilation
times and higher memory consumption. Another aspect
that has been yet inadequately considered and is closely
connected to repeated structures is vectorization. The
vector units of modern CPUs can be engaged to perform
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, executing
the same instruction on multiple data points in
parallel. This reveals a high potential for faster simulations.
This paper discusses the advantages of utilizing
repeated structures for modeling in order to achieve
both faster compilation and simulation times. The potentials
of preserving for loops throughout compilation
are demonstrated using a basic implementation in the
OpenModelica Compiler. The effect on the simulation
time by enabling vectorization is demonstrated for an appropriate
model.}

Modelica based vehicle models are used by many of the top teams because it enables a multi-domain vehicle model to be used in the simulators and support all the other simulation activities within the team. These technologies are now being deployed into road car applications which presents a number of additional challenges.

abstract = {Significant progresses in developing approaches to dynamic optimization have been made. However, its practical implementation poses a difficult task and its real-time application such as in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) remains challenging. A toolchain is developed in this work to relieve the implementation burden and, meanwhile, to speed up the computations for solving the dynamic optimization problem after transforming it to a nonlinear programming problem (NLP). To achieve these targets, symbolic computing is utilized for calculating the first and second order sensitivities on the one hand and parallel computing is used for separately accomplishing the computations for the individual time intervals on the other hand.
The toolchain consists of several open-source tools. The Modelica language is used to establish object-oriented models. The Optimica extension serves for the formulation of the optimal control problem. JModelica.org transforms the optimization model to a symbolic optimization model. The automatic differentiation and symbolic manipulations are done by means of CasADi. The interior-point optimizer Ipopt is applied to solve the NLP. The entire approach of the parallelized modified combined multiple-shooting and collocation (MCMSC) method is realized in the Python scripting language using the standard multi-processing module without any additional software packages.
Two optimal control problems, a satellite control and a combined cycle power plant start-up process, are solved. The efficiency of the developed toolchain, which solves one of the problems with approximately 25,000 variables in a reasonable CPU time, is demonstrated by speed-up factors. A comparison with the collocation approach in JModelica.org is also given.
In general, the larger the NLP and the more CPU cores are available, the greater the advantages of the proposed parallelized MCMSC approach will be.}

In this paper, we address the problem with a new method relying on directly using the specified power spectral density for a convolution filter.

The model’s validation has been conducted by comparing the model’s simulation results with the experimental results obtained in the IK4-TEKNIKER Solar Thermal Test Rig (LER).}

To realize the two continuous floors, a single wheel running gear configuration is selected. Equipped with independently rotating wheels instead of a usual wheel-set, a track guidance control becomes necessary. In terms of an advanced control and observer development the implementation of validated simulation models is absolutely essential. Therefore, the paper gives a short overview of the hardware of the scaled Experimental Running Gear on the DLR roller rig representing the NGT single wheel running gear. Using the DLR RailwayDynamics Library three different models of the running gear are implemented, which vary in complexity and can be used for different analysis methods. Finally, some significant simulation results of the particular simulation models are presented and discussed.}

abstract = {Nowadays, power electronic systems play a major role in almost every large system. Due to the high switching frequencies, the simulation of these devices is computationally very expensive and not suitable for system simulation. Average models of these power electronic systems are needed to simulate the basic terminal characteristics of these devices without the need to simulate every switching operation. This paper describes a Modelica implementation of a synchronous half-bridge converter for the use in an automotive power net simulation as well as in real-time environments. The model takes into account the losses in the semiconductors as well as the dynamic behavior of the converter. For the parametrization of the model, only the switching frequency and some values from the datasheets of the used components are required. To validate the proposed model, an equivalent SPICE model is developed, serving as a reference model. The dynamic behavior of the two models is compared using step responses of the load current. The relative deviation of the model’s output voltage compared to the SPICE simulation is less than 2%. Furthermore, also the energetic behavior was investigated, and it is shown that the proposed model provides good results for a wide operating area.}

Originally designed to address multi-physics, since its version 3.3 Modelica integrates constructions to describe discrete controllers. Now the question of using Modelica to design critical embedded software arises. In this paper we address the problem of defining a practical Modelica subset that can be entirely formalized and we sketch the formalization of this subset with a concrete example. This work should serve as a basis to define a suitable language that can be used to both simulate systems and generate embedded critical code.}

The model uses the formulation of Tillner-Roth and Friend (1998) in order to provide the best available single state thermodynamic data. The calculation of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) with the aid of the fundamental equation of state is examined. However due to difficulties found under certain pressure and temperature conditions, another method for calculating the VLE had to be used. The problems found included unreliable results and difficulties setting the initial values. Saturation temperature polynomials by Johnson (2001) have been found to be faster and more reliable and have been implemented instead. In result it&#8217;s possible to calculate thermophysical properties in single and two-phase region at pressures from the melting point up to 40 MPa.}

In the High Pressure Piston Prover the gas flow rate is determined by measuring the time a piston needs to displace a defined enclosed volume of gas. Fluctuating piston velocity during measurement can be a significant source of uncertainty if not considered in an appropriate way. A computational model was developed to investigate means for the reduction of this uncertainty. This model is presented in detail. It is written in Modelica. Validation of the model shows good compliance of the piston velocity in the model with measured data for certain volume flow rates. Reduction of the piston weight, variation of the start valve switching time and integration of a flow straightener were found to reduce the piston velocity fluctuations in the model significantly. Using Modelica as modeling language was a key for success, because Modelica is object-oriented and acausal. Furthermore the Modelica Standard Library has been utilized, which contains models from various physical domain such as thermodynamics, fluid flow and tribology.}

abstract = {The Modelica and FMI tool ecosystem is growing each year with new tools and methods becoming available. The open Modelica standard promises portability but it is important to ensure that a certain model behaves the same in different Modelica tools or in a different version of the same tool. It is also very important (for model evolution) to check that a new version of the same model produces comparable results. Finally, it is desirable to verify that a model exported in FMU form from a Modelica tool gives exactly the same results as the original model. This paper presents a framework for automatic regression testing as part of PySimulator which provides an efficient and concise way of testing if a model or a range of models behaves in the same way in several tools or versions of a tool by checking that the results produced are essentially identical. 
The FMI standard has been adopted by many tool vendors and is growing in popularity each year. This paper proposes a concept for building and simulating a system made from connected FMUs generated by different tools. The FMUs for Co-Simulation can be connected together using a GUI. The system model built graphically in this way can be saved for later use or simulated directly inside PySimulator. Active development is going on to support simulation of connected FMUs for Model Exchange.}

This paper discusses code generation for GPU cores. This is important when the model has regular structure, for example, discretization of PDEs. The behavior of each cell can then be partly described by a function call. The evaluation of such calls can then be made in parallel on the GPU cores. The same function is thus executed on every GPU core but operates on different data; the data of its cell.

Our GPU code generator automatically generates code for Modelica functions, i.e. no additional language constructs are needed. The function is just annotated as suitable for execution on a GPU.}

A new generation of energy-aware optimized building energy management system (BEMS) will be discussed and its advantages over the older controllers highlighted. The energy-aware optimisation will be shown on a model-based approach with an overall building system model enabling the assessment of the energy performance for different design and operation alternatives of the building automation system in interaction with the building.

To reduce the energy consumption in various actual driving conditions, considering overall running resistance from tire characteristics, mechanical losses and electrical losses is necessary. Also, to cope with reduced stability against external disturbances because of the light weight, it is necessary to apply vehicle dynamics control utilizing direct yaw moment control. In this paper, model-based development of system performance of a new EV is described. Full vehicle model considering both vehicle dynamics and energy consumption was developed using Modelica. Research for both structure and specification of components of the vehicle and also of the control were performed to find the solution to satisfy both energy consumption and vehicle dynamics by using the full vehicle model.}

Modelica models are translated to differential-algebraic equation systems and compiled to executable code pri-or to their execution in numerical solvers. The transla-tion gives a lot of possibilities for code optimization. This is particularly important for model-based control applications.

This paper investigates the exploitation of C++ for Modelica code optimization. C++ supports advanced programming concepts and at the same time aims to “leave no room for a lower-level language … (except for assembly code in rare cases)” [6]. 

The multitude of different requirements on arrays is treated with polymorphism. Templates keep the C++ code small and improve type safety. Built-in exception handling and destructors for memory management also contribute to smaller and more readable code. 

These ideas have been implemented in the OpenModel-ica C++ runtime. The paper describes its enhancement with new array features and with an FMI 2.0 interface. FMI serves as interface between modeling tools and control applications. In particular the new FMI 2.0 meets requirements of numerical optimization solvers in model-based control.

A publically available application example demon-strates the achievements. CPU times obtained with the OpenModelica C++ runtime are significantly faster than CPU times obtained with the C runtime or with Dymola.}

A newly developed wind turbine system dynamics library in the Modelica language is used to model an elastic wind turbine for a simulation study of the controller. The simulation results show a large reduction of the gust load on the wind turbine using the proposed controller.}

It is based on equilibrating the electrochemical potentials of the substances involved, following the modern theories of physical chemistry. It describes the chemical equilibration of homogeneous chemical solutions with fully thermodynamic states, supported through thermal, mechanical and electrical components of Modelica Standard Library 3.2.1. Even the complex processes can be composed from only a few base components, such as a component for the chemical solution, a component for the chemical substance or a component for the chemical reaction. Behind these components are fundamental laws of thermodynamics and physical chemistry. The library was designed to be very intuitive and easy to use. This paper shows how the library can be used to implement the examples of a lead-acid battery, a hydrogen-burning engine and the chloride shift of human red blood cells.}

No unifying theory exists for biology as it does for engineering domains. Thus, models appear in very diverse forms. Components can be genes, cells, organs or even whole ecosystems. These components can intuitively be represented as classes in an object-oriented language, making systems biology a perfect application for Modelica. However, we still only see very few models from this domain. In an attempt to change this, we show that Modelica can exactly reproduce the simulation results of a reference implementation of an established biological model of the human baroreflex. Our implementation highlights the strengths of Modelica like the event finding mechanism, which makes the model more precise.
We also show that biological systems pose interesting challenges like signals with non-uniform delays and the interaction of complex rhythms.}

The library is flexible enough to allow the implementation of control strategies for all the actuators present in urban environments (e.g. located in each vehicle, in a global server that computes set points for the vehicles or in the traffic management system that determines speed limits and traffic lights cycles).
The library is divided in two sections, macroscopic traffic and microscopic traffic. Macroscopic components are used to build road networks such as highways whereas microscopic components allow modeling city traffic where interactions between vehicles and their environment are high. 
Using city traffic library, cities can decrease traffic jam in their road network and they can improve the overhaul impact of the traffic on the environment.}

Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is a key element in the design of energy efficient buildings, and there is increasing interest in using the Modelica modelling language for BPS.The International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme (IEA-EBC) coordinates development of BPS in Modelica in the project "Computational Tools for Building and Community Energy Systems", also known as Annex 60.Even with advanced BPS libraries at hand, developing BPS models and collecting required input data are time-consuming and error-prone processes, preventing practitioners from using BPS more extensively in standard planning processes.Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a well established technology to model and manage the digital representation of a building over its entire lifecycle. Reusing existing Building Information Models (BIM) as basis for Building Performance Simulation (BPS) has the potential to make BPS model development and subsequent simulation easier, faster and more reliable.  Activity 1.3 of the Annex 60 project is working on an open-source tool-chain that can  semi-automatically generate code for BPS Modelica models from a BIM data source.  In this contribution, we give an overview over the tool-chain and the involved steps  as well as a more detailed description of those parts of the tool-chain that are used for controlling the workflow  and for the actual generation of Modelica source code files.}

More convenient definition of the piping system can be made, directly using the data from the CAD environment.

A tool has been developed, to extract data from CATIA piping 3D designs. This information is used to generate corresponding Modelica representation. 

Methodology based on the use of Modelica extends (inheritance) is applied to add controllers and other features to the generated model for dynamic simulation. Simulation results can be visualized directly in the 3D view of the piping design.

Specialized tools are developed, based on generated Modelica model, in order to enable quick calculations from the piping 3D design directly in the CAD environment.}

CAD uses a 3D representation to represent the assembly of a mechanism, i.e. how bodies are coupled with joints. This paper describes a generalization of object diagrams to utilize 3D representation of the icons/shapes and unification with assembly diagrams and exploded views.

The multidomain model uses components from the electrical and mechanical libraries, including commercialized library components from MapleSim’s Driveline Component Library and Battery Component Library.}

abstract = {End-of-line tests for automatic transmissions are mandatory to ensure quality and safety. The interaction of unit under test, test bench and test automation leads to
a high complexity in the development of test automation and test procedures. Validation of test automation and test procedures requires access to the test bench and the unit under test, both of which are only available close to startup of production. Therefore, virtualization of test bench and unit under test can be used to ease the bottleneck.

Virtualization is a common tool in the development of electronic control units for automotive applications using SIL and HIL technologies. The properties of simulation
models for a virtual end-of-line test bench differ from those for classical SIL and HIL environments. In this paper, an automatic transmission model suitable for a virtual end-of-line test bench is presented. The required characteristics of the multiple-disk clutch friction model are discussed in detail. Hydraulics are modeled
using a Moore machine to enable simulation of the pressure build-up characteristics during shift operation. With the resulting model, the influence of the key parameter
of a test procedure actuating an overlapping gearshift is investigated in a virtual test system.}

In this paper, we present a new fault injection method for liquid rocket pressurization and feed system (PFS) without modifying the system structure. Firstly, we develop a physics-based model of a pressurization and feed system based on Modelica, which describes both nominal and faulty behaviors in a unified way. Then, a new fault injection method is discussed, which uses the fault mode library and constructs association between the Modelica model and the fault mode by customized Modelica annotation in MWorks®. Consequently, several typical fault modes such as leakage and clogging are simulated to verify this method. The result shows that this new method could be easily used to simulate various kinds of fault modes in liquid rocket pressurization and feed system and the new fault simulation process indeed plays a role in the system design and could give some reference to ongoing fault detection and diagnoses.}

Additionally a graphical user interface for test authoring and management was created.}

Since this task was not foreseeable when designing the currently existing power plants, they will have to suffer completely different load scenarios than expected. Dynamic modelling of complete steam cycles is a promising way to study the power plant operation of various future scenarios. To adapt the model to real power plant behaviour, especially with a focus on control events, the implementation of effects due to steam blown into the gasside part of the boiler in order to detach soot from the heating surfaces (soot blowing) seem to bring great efforts concerning model validity. Furthermore special control optimizations can be done, for example on spray injection at soot blowing events. In this study temperature measurement data is used in combination with a highly detailed boiler model of a 550MW hard coal fired power plant to build a mathematical model of soot blowing influence on the different heat exchangers.}

Nowadays the flexibility in power production becomes increasingly important. This development is caused by the fluctuating power output from renewable energies, such as wind power and photovoltaic. A similar trend can be expected in other European countries and even world wide, where the expansion of renewable energies is pursued to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. Dynamic simulation models play a central role in improving the flexibility of power plants as they offer a tool for the evaluation of the resulting highly transient operation. 
This paper presents the dynamic modeling of a steam power plant in Modelica/Dymola, using the power plant library ClaRa (Clausius Rankine). The focus is on the detailed non-steady-state modeling of the steam generator and a simulation study about the increase of the load change rate.}

To demonstrate the approach, we use an example from the Modelica Standard Library and the use case of a district heating system model. We parse the Modelica model code to generate a {\tt System} graph that represents the model structure and its graphical layout. The graph drawing subsequently visualizes the results for every time-step. In the examples, we vary line thickness to visualize mass flow rates between two nodes and line color to show temperatures of the medium. We argue, that this approach can be a useful tool for modeling and analysis.}

A two-step process has been designed and implemented to parse Modelica artifacts and index the contents in a system knowledge repository. Afterwards, a case study has also been conducted to compare text vs. concept based information retrieval processes. A dataset of 25 electrical circuits and a set of 30 queries have been designed to extract precision and recall metrics assessing that the presented approach improves the retrieval of Modelica artifacts. As main conclusion, it is possible to state that a domain specific technology such as RSHP for knowledge representation can help the management of Modelica artifacts as knowledge assets.}

The purpose is to provide guidelines that will allow

We provide an analysis for direct input-output dependencies of
such components and
discuss how these dependencies can lead to algebraic loops
that are formed when connecting thermofluid flow components.

Based on this analysis, we provide recommendations
that increase the computing efficiency of such components
and systems that are formed by connecting multiple components.
We explain what code optimizations are lost when providing
thermofluid flow components as FMUs rather than Modelica code.
We present an implementation of a package for FMU export 
of such components, explain the rationale for selecting
the connector variables of the FMUs and finally provide
computing benchmarks for different design choices.
It turns out that selecting temperature rather than
specific enthalpy as input and output signals does not
lead to a measurable increase in computing time, but
selecting many small FMUs
rather than a large FMU considerably increases
computing time.}

This work describes a methodology for obtaining a linear State Space Model (SSM) of Building Energy Simulation (BES) models, consisting of walls, windows, floors and the zone air. The methodology uses the Modelica library IDEAS to develop a BES model, including its non-linearities, and automates its linearisation. The Dymola function Linearize2 is used to generate the state space formulation, facilitating further mathematical manipulations, or simulation in different environments. Optionally this model can then be reduced for control purposes using model order reduction (MOR) techniques. The methodology is illustrated for an office building for which a maximum error of 0.7 K between the Modelica BES model and the SSM is observed.}

abstract = {A common situation in industry is that a system model (here a composite model) is composed of several sub-models which may have been developed using different tools. FMI is one important technology for exporting/importing models between tools and/or connecting them via co-simulation. TLM based modeling and co-simulation is another important technique for modeling, connecting, and simulation of especially mechanical systems, which is simple, numerically stable, and efficient. A number of tool-specific simulation models, such as Modelica models, SimuLink models, Adams models, BEAST models, etc., have successfully been connected and simulated using TLM based co-simulation. However, previously there was no general open source tool for creation, graphic editing, and simulation of composite models connected via FMI or TLM based co-simulation. In this paper we present a graphical composite model editor based on OpenModelica which is integrated with the OpenModelica and the SKF TLM co-simulation frameworks to support both FMI and TLM based composite model editing and simulation. The editor supports creating, viewing and editing a composite model both in textual and graphical representation. The system supports simulation of composite models consisting of sub-models created using different tools.}

keywords = { Modelica},
abstract = {The smart power grids will extensively rely on network control to increase efficiency, reliability, and safety; to enable plug-and-play asset integration, such as in the case of distributed generation and alternative energy sources; to support market dynamics as well as reduce peak prices and stabilize costs when supply is limited. In turn, network control requires an advanced communication infrastructure with support for safety and real-time communication.

Simulating such complex systems is a key objective for the development of Smart Grids. Several simulation tools are available on the market but these tools have two major drawbacks:
•	They are generally not designed to import models developed for other tools.
•	They are not adapted to large scale complex system of systems or cyber-physical systems as smart grids which require time-consuming calculation.
One solution to bypass these drawbacks is to use a co-simulation platform which can connect together several simulators and FMUs (Functional Mock-up unit).

ER and D is funding the development of its own co-simulation platform dedicated to the Smart Grids in partnership with LORIA-INRIA. A first release of this tool named MECSYCO is available under the Affero GPL license v3 (http://mecsyco.loria.fr/). The next published version (at the end of 2015) will upgrade MECSYCO with the coupling of different types of discrete-time or continuous-time simulators (including the FMUs) divided in three domains:
•	The physics domain (process) : FMUs exported according to the FMI 2.0 standard from Dymola with models built from the EDF Modelica library GridSysPro or historical tools widely used at EDF (e.g. EMTP-RV) now compatible with the FMI standard; 
•	The telecommunication domain: NS-3, OMNeT++ or OPNeT ;
•	The Information System domain with models designed with UML/SysML oriented tools.
MECSYCO is based on the Multi-Agent concept (one agent per simulator to describe a heterogeneous multi-model) and on the DEVS formalism (to conceive a decentralized execution algorithm respecting the causality constraints).

This paper provides first an overview of the ER and D Modelica library GridSysPro (GSP) composed of electrical components mapped on the zone related to the process of a Smart Grid. Besides that, to comply with the modeling of large scale electrical networks, a solution to co-initialize several interconnected FMUs exported from Dymola is described.}

In the first step the unit commitment problem (UCP) is solved using mixed integer linear models and standard mixed-integer solvers. In the second step the economic dispatch problem is solved, utilizing the unit statuses from the UCP. This step involves dynamic optimization of non-linear physics-based models. Both optimizations aim at maximizing the production profit.

The modeling has focused on distributed consumption and production. Optimization results show that modeling of the district heating net impacts the production planning in several ways, with results such as reduction of production peaks and delay of costly unit start-ups.

The physics-based modeling and dynamic optimization techniques provide a flexible way to formulate the optimization problem and include constraints of physically important variables such as supply temperature, pressures and mass flows.}

First, the working-principle is explained and common challenges in control-system design-problems related to these valves are illustrated. 
Then, a Modelica-model is presented in detail, taking into account several physical domains.
It is then shown, how limit cycle oscillations occuring in aircraft energy systems can be represented with this model.
Finally, some multi-domain interactive effects are described.}

The components and the full system were tested

to data from the reference system. The dynamic behavior
of the models aligned with expectations, although time
constants could not be evaluated due to lack of dynamic

abstract = {In the field of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, parabolic trough systems with thermal oil as heat transfer fluid represent the technically and economically most mature technology. Due to storage systems these plants produce electricity on demand. However, a considerable portion of the annually collected thermal energy is consumed for the start-up procedure. In fact, after shut-down periods thermal masses must be reheated and additionally further energy losses due to imperfect start-up procedures occur. The present work has been carried out within the TURIKON project. The main goal is to evaluate and to optimize the transient behavior, namely the start-up of parabolic trough plants with thermal oil. For this purpose, a dynamic model was developed. An internal DLR solar library was used for the modelling of the solar field while the power block is modelled with the publically available ThermoPower library where some components had to be adapted for the needs of CSP plants. In the present publication first results are shown in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the plant model. The dynamic behavior of the power plant during normal operating mode and during a warm and a hot start-up procedure is evaluated and the warm start-up procedure energetically optimized.

Aiming at this problem, a new organization method of Modelica library based on database is proposed. The main principle of this method is that the organization objects are models rather than files. Through interacting with database storing metadata describing models, it is available to achieve model management based on the granularity of single model. Finally, a network-based multi-domain unified modeling and simulation platform is developed on the basis of the model management architecture.}

abstract = {A model of the multibody dynamics for an omni wheel assuming embedded in a frame of wider dynamical environment of the whole vehicle is under development and verification. Modelica base classes developed earlier for the multibody applications with contacts involving friction are used. Generalization has been performed for the model of contact tracking algorithm between roller and horizontal floor. Generalization includes non-zero angle between the roller axis of rotation and plane of the omni wheel. Contact tracking algorithm is implemented in two cases: (a) implicit and (b) explicit. Models for these cases (a) and (b) are currently “embedded” into the omni vehicle model earlier verified. For simplicity we analyze a multibody system comprising the wheel plus set of rollers being mounted along its circumference. A remainder of the vehicle is replaced by the wrench properly arranged in a way such that the wheel keeps its vertical orientation permanently. The performed computations have shown that two algorithms of the contact tracking generate completely identical dynamics of the whole multibody system. }

abstract = {The academic society claims the use of virtual engineering (i.e. simulation) since many years. Nevertheless, it is de facto rarely ever used in the automation industry. This paper presents an approach and a toolchain for an integrated, digital engineering workflow including virtual commissioning, shown at a real industrial example. In particular, a new method for virtual commissioning that allows to drop all real-time requirements is presented. Cyber-physical production systems rising with the concepts of industry 4.0 have a complexity that conventional engineering methods cannot bear. Therefore, the time has come to finally use model-based systems engineering methodologies that were proposed years ago, e.g. (Verein Deutscher Ingnieure (2004)). Nevertheless, the automation industry acts very conservative towards new technology. This is mainly due to the distrust that model-based methods can be used in an economic manner. Within the development cycle in the automation industry CAD models are used, since they save costs compared to construction by hand. During other stages of the development cycle, virtual models are considered to be of little or no use, since the effort for modeling those images of real systems is assumed to excel the benefits. This prejudice can only be overcome by lowering the effort for modeling or increasing the value of generated models. In this paper models generated in early development phases are re-utilized within later stages of the development cycle, like application engineering and commissioning. The re-use of models for virtual commissioning is in particular possible due to coupling of a Rexroth PLC and a (possibly non real-time) Modelica simulation using a newModelica library. In order to obtain an development cycle that is as integrated as possible, transitions between different phases in the development cycle are tackled. First, starting with CAD data it is shown how to automatically generate a physical representation of a machinery in Modelica. Using the physical interfaces of Modelica the model can easily be extended by drive models from component manufacturers. In combination with Bosch Rexroth PLCs, a transition towards the commissioning phase without further adaptions (e.g. complexity reduction for real-time application) is possible employing a new Modelica library. To show the entire potential of an integrated engineering workflow based on Modelica, an approach for creating control code based on a Modelica model of the control algorithm is given. By demonstrating those methods in the industrial application example of a bottling machine, it is disclosed that the assumptions of a high effort for creating simulation models, as mentioned introductory, can be disproved. }

Modelica is an equationbased object-oriented modeling language. Electrical components in the Electric power library (EPL) from Modelon were used to model power electronic units, grids and other electrical infrastructures. The outcome of this effort was simulation results which clearly demonstrate that the developed controllers enable scalable and controllable DC power grids. }

Conventional computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering (CAD/CAE) systems are well established in this regard. However, although upstream design is particularly important in product development to add value and incorporate the required functions, it is difficult to apply conventional shapebased CAD/CAE systems to the upstream design stage due to the lack of design information at that stage. As a solution to this issue, we are proposing the development of a design framework called “1DCAE”, which can be applied to the early design stage of product development including the conceptual and functional design phases. The 1DCAE concept can be applied not only better design, must design, but delight design. Here we introduce how 1DCAE concept applies to delight design and its core technology of kansei modeling. }

Multi-physics system simulation for realistic representations of powertrains and their behavior combined with dynamic driving simulation allows for optimizations of the transmission control unit for an automatic transmission by employing advanced driver assistance systems for an increased efficiency through anticipatory shifting. Realistic load cases that are based on measured data help optimize fuel consumption and driveline dynamics with respect to the control algorithms by using variation calculations with variable transmission parameters. This works also the other way around when control algorithms are validated and optimized quickly and free of risk as part of rapid prototyping. }

abstract = {In-order to analyse the distributed supply and storage of energy in decentralised clusters, Modelica has been used to model buildings with micro Combined Heat and Power (µ-CHP) systems as their primary heat energy source. The classification of the buildings involve generalising their size based attributes. Therefore, different buildings, appropriate µ-CHP systems used inside them, the components for heat and electrical energy storage as well as associated control systems are modelled. The output power of µ-CHP systems and the dimensions of the storage units are chosen corresponding to the building size to account for space heating, warm water demand and electrical energy storage requirements. The control strategy used is heat prioritised where the power generated is either used in-house or fed back into the grid. Following the modelling of components, decentralised storage potential is analysed using distributed Power-to-Heat (PtH) as a storage strategy. To store the electrical energy locally, battery models are integrated with a power interface system. As an initial part of analysing distributed storage potential, various house types with µ-CHP units are simulated with measured weather dependent boundary conditions. Subsequently, potential integration of distributed storage into a larger storage strategy involving the electrical grid and the gas grid is discussed where the µ-CHP units could act as an interface enabling a symbiotic relationship between the power grid and the gas grid.}

For testing more than 20 Modelica examples were developed from which FMUs for cosimulation were generated by established simulation tools (e.g., Dymola, SimulationX).

abstract = {Due to the increasing complexity of technical systems, model-based engineering is getting more and more important during the development process of new products. The code generation from models and the usage of this code on hardware targets is one important feature of model-based development. To execute this code on the hardware device, a simulation runtime is additionally required, which offers numerical methods to solve the model equations. To use generated code on a controller, the simulation has to be executed in real-time, which is a huge requirement for the solver. In this work, a Modelica-based open source toolchain for model-based engineering with Rexroth controllers is presented, which is used for virtual commissioning of a typical hydromechanical system on a standard Rexroth PLC. Therefore, instead of parameterizing the controller directly on the real system, the control algorithm on the PLC is connected to the system model, which is additionally executed on the controller in parallel to the existing PLC application. Doing this, the commissioning times can be reduced significantly, as the commissioning process can already be started during the build-up of the system using a simulation model of the system. As hydro-mechanical systems are in general mathematically stiff, the choice of the solver for the system model equations is not arbitrary. In this work, five different real-time solvers, beginning with a simple explicit Euler through to more complex linearly implicit methods, are tested on a single hydraulic axis. Furthermore, typical issues like state events as well as algebraic loops are discussed in context of real-time simulation requirements. }
