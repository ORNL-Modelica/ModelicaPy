abstract = {We introduce a tool for obtaining optimal control and estimation problems from graphical models. Graphical models are constructed by combining blocks that can be implemented in Modelica or taken from a palette. The models can be used for predictive control; moving horizon estimation; and/or parameter estimation. We show that the solution time and robustness of the resulting nonlinear program strongly depends on the way the model was built and translated. These observations yield modeling guidelines
for increasing robustness and efficiency of the optimization. In particular; we find out that eliminating as many variables as possible from the optimization problem may help a lot.}

abstract = {The constructor and operator overloading introduced in Modelica 3.1 is discussed. The goal is that elementary operators like “+” or “*” can be overloaded for records. This makes it possible to define and use; in a convenient way; complex numbers; polynomials; transfer functions; state space systems; etc. The chosen approach is different to other languages: (a) Only scalar operations need to be overloaded. Array operations are then automatically available; so the growth of the number of overloaded functions is avoided. (b) Automatic type casts between different data types is performed using overloaded constructor functions. Again this reduces the number of overloaded functions. (c) The approach is conservative and only allows overloading if no ambiguity is present; in order to not introduce pitfalls into the language. This is reached by basing the overloading on disjoint sets of matching functions and not on a priority match.}

Furthermore; new blocks are introduced to define actions in a visual way; and not textually.

Modeling the sound propagation in ducts by one dimensional acoustic twoport methods is a well-established technique for the acoustic characterization of large HVAC duct networks. Two different approaches of acoustic modeling will be considered in the framework: When resonant phenomena are insignificant; it is often sufficient to apply band-averaged models to predict the sound power level and the transmission loss within the individual components of the duct network. For the low frequency range where linear plane wave propagation is valid; acoustic two and multi-port models based on a transmission matrix formulation of the sound pressure can be applied for high frequency resolution and phase accurate calculations. For the prediction of the mean air flow in the duct network pressure loss models are applied. The coupling of acoustic and flow elements permits the simulation of flow acoustic phenomena.

For setting up large networks a smooth work flow is vital for the user: The simulation is easily set up using the GUI provided by Dymola. External parameterisation ensures persistent data management. The resulting system of equations is automatically pre-processed and solved by Dymola.

In this paper an overview of this new library is given together with exemplary applications.}

abstract = {Derivative-based optimization methods for parameter estimation require good start values in order to converge to the global optimum. A conventional multistart strategy is often not practical for identifying such start values; especially for high dimensional problems. Moreover; the computational efforts for each iteration of the optimizer are significantly increased by the computation of parameter sensitivities. We hence present a multistart recursive clustering strategy that utilizes DAE decomposition algorithms; in particular Tarjan’s and tearing algorithms. These algorithms are also used by standard Modelica compilers for improving the performance of solving large DAE systems. Our key concept
is to provide a natural decomposition of the parameter estimation problem into smaller clusters (i.e. subproblems); each of which requires fewer start values and less computation. The resulting local minima are taken as start values for enlarged subproblems; and so forth until good start values for the original problem are found. This approach serves to improve global convergence and computational speed of multistart derivative-based optimization strategies for large sparse DAE systems.}

Modelica is a valuable platform from which to explore FCs because it is appropriate for the representation of physical
interactions. This paper describes elements of a FC library which has been developed in Modelica. The goal of the modeling effort is to take full advantage of the physically representative nature of the Modelica language. To this end; it is important for the models to be consistent and explicit in terms of energy and species balances. The paper
emphasizes the representation of diffusion and electrochemical processes. In these areas; the traditional approach is to represent empirically observed behavior; and this is not necessarily rigorous from the standpoint of energy and species balances. To describe the diffusion and electrochemical processes in a form that is suitable for Modelica;
alternative and possibly more physically fundamental model equations have been developed.}

Whereas Modelica has been designed for modeling physical systems from first principles; some systems do not lend themselves to this kind of modeling; either because they are too poorly understood (no meta-knowledge is available yet) or because they are so complex that capturing their behavior in a detailed fashion would be a hopeless undertaking.

Use of the new library is demonstrated by means of two examples; a simple hydraulic control system (a textbook example) and a model of the human cardiovascular system.}

Other alternatives based on signal flow oriented modeling have severe restrictions how components can be connected together.

Modelica.Fluid provides interfaces and basic components for the device-oriented modeling of onedimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks containing vessels; pipes; fluid machines; valves and fittings.

A unique feature of Modelica.Fluid is that the component equations and the media models as well as pressure loss and heat transfer correlations are decoupled from each other. All components are implemented such that they can be used for media from the Modelica.Media library. This means that an incompressible or compressible medium; a single or a multiple substance medium with one or more phases might be used with one and the same model as long as the modeling assumptions made hold. Furthermore;
trace substances are supported.

Modeling assumptions can be configured globally in an outer System object. This covers in particular the initialization; uni- or bi-directional flow; and dynamic or steady-state formulation of mass; energy; and momentum balance. All assumptions can be locally refined for every component.
 
While Modelica.Fluid contains a reasonable set of component models; the goal of the library is not to provide a comprehensive set of models; but rather to provide interfaces and best practices for the treatment of issues such as connector design and implementation of energy; mass and momentum balances. Applications from various domains are presented.}

Several such usages arise in the area of control engineering; where Linear Fractional Transformations (LFTs); derivation of robotic controllers; optimization; and real time code generation are some examples. The choice of XML is motivated by its defacto standard status and the availability of free and efficient tools. Also; the XSLT language enables specification of transformation of the XML model representation into other formats.}

abstract = {Two elastic gearbox models with friction losses are presented; a 1-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) and a 3-DOF model.

The presented models have advantages over the existing lossy gear model of the Modelica Standard Library when gear vibrations are of interest. Care has been taken that also in the case of gear locking; the elasticity effects are treated adequately.

In addition to external excitations; it is now also possible to model internal excitations of the gearbox caused by the varying stiffness and/ or damping. This varying stiffness can be specified by the user for each gear wheel. This feature can for instance be used to model tooth interaction or broken gears.

Furthermore; the 3-DOF elastic model can simulate the elasticity of the support bearings in the load direction; which is impossible in the standard lossy gear model.}

abstract = {This paper presents an alternative concept of modelling multibody systems within Modelica; the socalled motor calculus. This approach was introduced by R. VON MISES in 1924 and can be used to describe the dynamical behaviour of spatial multibody systems in a very efficient way. While the equations clearly take a very simple form in terms of motor algebra; the numerical efficiency is still an open question.

In the paper; first some fundamentals of motor calculus are summarized. An experimental implementation of motor algebra is used to measure and analyse the numerical efficiency and performance regarding the simulation time of VON MISES’ approach. Therefore; some components of the Modelica Multibody Standard Library were modified in order to compare both implementations. Finally; some examples are given to prove the applicability and correctness of the concept but also to serve as a basis for a discussion of the numerical performance. The chosen approach utilizes all object-oriented features provided by the modelling language. Besides; it gives reason for the present endeavours to introduce the possibility of operator overloading within Modelica.}

An approach under consideration develops in a natural way the contact model constructed earlier. Generally an analytic computation of the integrals in the Contensou–Erismann model leads to the cumbersome calculation; decades of terms; including rational functions depending in turn on complete elliptic integrals. To implement the elastic bodies contact interaction computer model fast enough one builds up an approximate model in the way initially proposed by Contensou.

To verify the model built results obtained by several authors were applied. First the Tippe-Top dynamic model is used as an example under testing. It turned out the top revolution process is identical to one simulated with use of the set-valued functions approach. In addition; the ball bearing dynamic model was also used to verify different approaches to the tangent forces computational implementation in details. A model objects corresponding to contacts between balls and raceways were replaced by ones of a new class developed here. Then the friction model of the approximate Contensou type embedded into the whole bearing dynamic model was thoroughly tested.}

The contribution aspect of this work is twofold: on one side the entire cross-compilator software chain is built within the same framework; on the other hand; all the involved software tools are opensource (mainly GPL) licensed; making the application extremely modular and extensible. Furthermore this work will be included in the next release of the open source Modelica environment SimForge; thus enriching its Modelica back-ends support.}

The library contains dynamic and steady-state component models that are applicable for analyzing fast transients when designing control algorithms and for conducting annual simulations when assessing energy performance. For most models; dimensional analysis is used to compute the performance for operating points that differ from nominal conditions. This allows parameterizing models in the absence of detailed geometrical information which is often impractical to obtain during the conceptual design phase of building systems.

In the first part of this paper; the library architecture and the main classes are described. In the second part; an example is presented in which we implemented a model of a hydronic heating system with thermostatic radiator valves and thermal energy storage.}

From measurements it is well known that overall drag torques of vehicle gearboxes vary significantly over the range of operating points and speeds; depending on the interaction of the losses of the single gearbox elements like bearings; gearings; etc. Because today’s vehicle emission regulations are becoming stricter and stricter "drag torque design" of gearboxes will be even more important in the future. Prediction of losses helps to save cost (e.g. drag torque measurements); speeds up the development and allows to assess many concepts in short time.

We collected detailed semi-analytical drag models for the common gearbox components from literature and from manufacturer information and implemented them in a Modelica library. This library contains models for radial shaft seals; rotary unions; synchronizers; multi-disc clutches; helical gearings; planetary gearings; various kinds of bearings; lubrication systems and lubricant characteristics. Using this library drag torques of any vehicle gearbox may be computed for any operating condition (engaged gear;
speed; torque; temperature). Simulation results for a 7 speed double clutch transmission show good correlation with measurements.}

This paper will present the development of a vehicle system model in Modelica that is used to study the overall vehicle power-train torsional vibrations that impact Noise; Vibration & Harshness (NVH) characteristics of the vehicle. In this study; a detailed crank-angle resolved; multi-cylinder engine model is constructed; which includes intake/exhaust dynamics; combustion; heat transfer; engine friction and rotational dynamics of piston-crank mechanism. The engine model accurately reproduced real-world engine torque and acceleration fluctuations. The lumped parameter powertrain system model which includes clutch (and associated vibration isolation components); transmission; driveline and chassis is developed and used with the engine model to predict torsional vibrations. This system model is used to understand the powertrain torsional vibration characteristics in different operating regions such as idling; driving and coasting conditions.

To demonstrate the applicability of the developed models; results of unit tests for independent components; especially the engine torque variation and the clutch torsion characteristic; and the system-level quantitative validation with test data are presented. A special model that does fast Fourier transform of the signal on the fly is presented and its role in the analysis discussed. We present a comparison of rattle noise between two compliant clutch (isolator) designs and discuss the rattle metrics used in the analysis. Generic considerations for the deployment of such system level models are also discussed in this paper.}

In addition to the validation of technical features; the assessment of man-machine interaction has become more important within complex working environments. In cases where most attention is paid to the human as the operator; simulations have to fulfil special requirements. Allowing the user to interact with the system implies the need for real time simulation as well as flexible hardware integration and a powerful visualisation. Therefore a modular software framework called SARTURIS3 has been developed meeting all these requirements. In order to support flexible multidomain modelling the Modelica language is being used. This paper presents SARTURIS and its applications; focusing on the integration of Modelica based on OpenModelica using the example of a wheel loader. Since OpenModelica is not yet able to deal with the Modelica Multibody library; a Python-based tool called PyMbs has been developed. It allows comfortable description of multibody systems and export to Modelica code as well as other formats.}

abstract = {Traditionally; multibody systems have been defined in Modelica by connecting bodies and joints in a model diagram. Additionally the user must enter values for parameters defining masses; inertias and three dimensional vectors of positions and orientations. More convenient definition of multibody systems can be made using a 3D editor available; for example; in CATIA from Dassault Systèmes with immediate 3D viewing.

A tool has been developed that translates a CATIA model to Modelica by traversing the internal CATIA structure to get information about parts and joints and how they are related. This information is then used to generate a corresponding Modelica model. The traversal provides information about the reference coordinate system; the center of mass in the local coordinate system; the mass; the inertia; the shape and color of the body exported in VRML format for animation purposes and the icon exported as a PNG file to be used in the Modelica diagrams.

The Modelica diagram layout is automatically generated and is based on the spanning tree structure of the mechanism. Models obtained in this way often contain redundant constraints. A new method has been developed for Dymola to facilitate simulation of such models; i.e. the model reduction is performed automatically.

An important property of the translated model is the possibility to use Modelica extends (inheritance) for adding controllers and other features of the model for dynamic simulation. For instance; the engine model can be extended by introducing models of the gas forces of the combustion acting on the cylindrical joints of the pistons. In that  way; the translated model is separated and can be changed independently of the added models.}

To solve this problem a way was developed and tested for some SPICE3 semiconductor models. The actual library is presented and further plans are shown.}

Using average models to simulate them brings a drastic decrease of computation time. Such models do not take into account switching. They are a good compromise between complexity; computing time and acceptable accuracy at a system level. Even if the method to build these models is well identified; it still requires a lot of manipulation to get from the very structure description to the simulation code.

This new method will allows us to perform the pre-dimensioning and pre-placement of the components; through a simple modeling process in DYMOLA environment. We expect the result to be a more rapid pre-dimensioning procedure for the electrical circuits.}

In this work a constraint is developed where this  line is replaced by some curve described by some suitable geometry: A Pointto-Curve (PtCv) constraint. It turns out that there are several options to define the orientation of the second frame with respect to the first one. Additional degrees of freedom are possible. These ideas can be applied to 2D: A Point-to-Surface (PtSf) constraint . PtCv and PtSf constraints seem to be suitable building blocks for higher order constraints: Curve-to-Curve (CvCv) resp. Surface-to-Surface (SfSf) constraints. As a byproduct there are some Joint models not yet available in the MSL at all or not in that form; like an elementary Cylindrical joint.}

Questions about the right operational strategy; particularly during unsteady operation states; come to the fore; and therewith the need to carry out transient simulations of entire tower power plants including the heliostat field. Meeting this necessity; the presented simulation approach opens the way to transient full plant simulations of solar tower power plants. A detailed
heliostat field model was linked to a dynamic receiver model by coupling both simulation tools. A second coupling was established to a tool hosting a control panel of the heliostat field model. With this simulation approach; a start-up procedure and a tracking stop were simulated delivering different transient behaviors of local absorber temperatures and mass flows.}

abstract = {Steam turbine technology is one of the leading technologies used in electricity production since more than one hundred years. In recent time requirements for steam turbines have been changing slowly. Steam turbines are not longer used in power plants with high operation times and a high full load share only; but are also implemented in combined cycle power plants or solar thermal power plants. This type of plants requires good dynamic behavior of the steam turbine due to fast and frequent start ups and  daily cycling.

To optimize the performance of this kind of power plants and their components it is necessary to simulate and analyze their dynamic behavior. Therefore; a general model approach for steam turbines within Modelica has been developed. This model approach is based on a general model; which can be adjusted to the necessary model depth as described in this paper.

Steam turbines in a solar thermal power plant with direct steam generation must fulfill special requirements regarding their dynamic behavior. Hence; this model is applied as an example to explain the behavior of an industrial steam turbine used in such plants. Furthermore; this paper shows first results of simulations with turbine models. To validate the model; the results are compared with results from the Siemens internal steady state calculation tool. Since results stay within the estimated accuracy; the model approach can be used for further calculations.

The dynamic behavior of the turbine is analyzed by using typical solar irradiance disturbances. This analysis shows that no critical operation points occur within the turbine.}

abstract = {The reduction of automotive fuel consumption is a major challenge of automotive OEMs and suppliers. It is expected; that during the next decade the majority of vehicles will still be driven by internal combustion engines (ICE). As a rule of thumb about 2/3 of the fuel energy fed to the engine is converted into heat and is used only occasionally and only partly for heating the interior. One promising technology to convert exhaust heat into usable electric energy is the thermoelectric generator (TEG) [1]. As this component has significant retroactive effects on the automotive system; a system-level model of the car was developed to calculate the net benefit of the TEG for steady-state operating-points as well as for dynamic driving cycles.

This paper presents a model and simulation results of an ICE-powered vehicle with thermoelectric waste heat-utilization. The model uses component models of the AlternativeVehicles-; VehicleInterfaces-; PowerTrain-and YaFluid-Library.}

Four different hybrid vehicles are implemented as sample applications using the newly-developed architecture. The scheme and canonical library structure for the component; subsystem; and system models is also discussed to document a mechanism for user-friendly handling of parameterized models and fully-implemented models in a complex model architecture with extensive model data. Models and simulation results are shown for the Toyota Prius; Lexus RX400h; a concept hybrid sedan; and a concept hybrid sport utility vehicle (SUV). Extensions to VehicleInterfaces are also proposed to enhance the library to include additional features to improve support for future conventional and hybrid vehicle modeling efforts.}

abstract = {Accurate simulation of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) requires detailed models of several subsystems in different physical domains. The most important subsystems are the hydraulic brake system; the tire and the control algorithm. The creation of detailed models of each subsystem in a single modeling tool may be difficult if not impossible. To overcome this; co-simulation may be used to combine the strengths of different tools. In this article; co-simulation between Dymola and Abaqus is used to investigate the performance of an ABS algorithm with a highly detailed finite-element tire model. The brake system hydraulics along with the control algorithm are simulated in Dymola while the tire model; the wheel; the braking caliper and the contact with the road are simulated in Abaqus.

While computationally more expensive than a traditional modeling approach when a semi-analytical tire model (such as the Magic Formula model) may be used to model the tire and tire road interaction; the approach described in this paper includes a fair amount of details when modeling of the tread; the tire plies; the wire reinforcements in the tire and the contact with the road. The necessary data is exchanged between the two applications using the co-simulation capabilities available in Abaqus and the .DLL option in Dymola. Sensors in Abaqus provide information about the mechanical state of the system such as forward translational velocity; angular velocity/acceleration and the free rolling effective radius. This information is communicated to Dymola at frequent simulation time intervals at runtime. Dymola uses this information as inputs and computes the brake caliper clamp force. This force is communicated in turn to Abaqus which determines the force on the brake rotor.}

The library delivers a broad range of verified and validated correlations describing convective heat transfer and pressure loss of fluids in energy devices. These correlations are numerically optimised to provide efficient and stable transient simulations. The library also provides convective heat transfer models and flow models of most heat transfer and pressure loss correlations using the also free and open source MODELICA_FLUID library as thermo-hydraulic framework for system simulation.

Scope; implementation concept; numerical challenges; verification and validation of the FLUIDDISSIPATION library will be exemplarily described (e.g. for convective heat transfer and pressure loss of twophase flow).

Industrial applications for thermo-hydraulic system simulation (e.g. air distribution circuit for supplemental cooling; aircraft engine fuel feeding system) are presented using FLUIDDISSIPATION correlations implemented within MODELICA_FLUID models. A detailed documentation is available in the library itself.}

This paper presents three different control concepts for a swash plate compressor using a built-in control valve. Therefore a model for a one-phase R744 expansion valve was developed and adapted to detailed measurement data. To achieve high reliability in the simulation; the entire R744 refrigerant cycle was validated using analyses of measurement data from an IfT test bench. The simulation of the refrigeration cycle components was realised using TIL (TLK-IfT-Library). The main focus was set as the description of the compressor with its internal and external mass flow rates. The internal mass flow; which is directed through the crankcase; directly affects the crankcase pressure. It is also called the control mass flow. As a result of the crankcase pressure an adjustable mechanism regulates the displacement as shown in figure 1. The greater the displacement; the greater is the inclination angle. This is caused by different load incidence points on the swash plate e.g. by springs; pistons and pressure states. A comparison of different control concepts shows the characteristic and control behaviour of each of them relating to control time and control mass flow rate. Whenever a control mass flow occurs; it implicates throttle losses. The dissipated energy can be minimised using another control concept.}

abstract = {The starch mashing phase; the first one in the brewing process; has a fundamental influence on the quality of the final product. In particular; a good temperature control can significantly reduce the product variability; and also improve the process efficiency by (slightly) reducing the mashing phase duration. In this work; controloriented models o f the mashing process; including biochemical reactions’ representation and energy balance equations; are used to synthesise and test some temperature control schemes. The mix of equation- and algorithm-based modelling allowed by Modelica allows to size the control equipment to the (nearly) final detail; including for example the comparison of different types of heating actuators.}

The standard process for the compilation of Modelica models is insufficient since it requires the flattening of the system and generates thereby overly large executables. In this paper we elaborate the concept of module-preserving compilation. This technique aims to generate more compact executables and thereby shall enable the simulation of very large systems in the future. To this end; we introduce an appropriate terminology and design a set of data structures and algorithms that enable the embedment of module preservation into the translation of Modelica models. This paper represents theoretical work only and aims to open up a fruitful discussion on this topic.}

The study is carried out in the Modelica-Dymola environment; and focuses on the quadruple-coil direct-drive motor of a modern fly-by-wire servovalve. Starting from basic information about material properties and from a schematic representation of the system geometry; the motor model is created mainly using the components of the Modelica_Magnetic library. The motor performances are then characterised with reference to both the normal operating condition (four active coils) and the worst-case fault-tolerant condition (only two active coils); in terms of current-to-force and current-to-displacement curves. The Modelica model is finally validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental data obtained during previous research activities. The Modelica results are also compared with those provided by a Matlab-Simulink model of the motor; pointing out the advantages of the object-oriented approach for the study of complex electro-magnetic systems. The easy modelling of magnetic circuit networks and the inherent simulation of magnetic material properties  allow to achieve accurate results very efficiently; taking into account physical phenomena that are often disregarded during preliminary design phases; such as magnetic saturation or magnetic flux dispersions.}

One reason the support for structural dynamics is limited in present mainstream non-causal modelling and simulation languages is that they are designed and implemented on the assumption that symbolic processing of models and ultimately compilation of simulation code takes place prior to simulation. We seek to lift that restriction; without sacrificing efficiency; by exploiting just-in-time (JIT) compilation to allow new simulation code; reflecting structural changes; to be generated as the simulation progresses. Our work is carried out in a framework called Functional Hybrid Modelling that supports higher-order modelling; as higher-order modelling lends itself naturally to expressing  structural dynamism. However; the central ideas of the paper should be of general interest in the area of structural dynamism. The paper provides an in-depth description of the implementation techniques we have developed as well as a performance evaluation.}

With help of this analysis; improvement of energetic efficiency by using an ejector can be set in relation to the potential improvement in efficiency of other components such as heat exchangers. Information about entropy production associated with energy dissipation allows for an objective estimation of the optimization potential of each component within an ejector refrigeration cycle. In addition; the improvement due to the specific process control of the ejector cycle compared to the conventional heat pump cycle can be analyzed. The energetic benefit gained using an ejector depends on the refrigerant used. The refrigerants R134a and R744 (CO2) were compared in regard to the entropy production of the heat pump system.
 
In order to simulate an ejector refrigerant cycle and to evaluate the energy dissipation by means of entropy production; existing models for cycle components were modified. Applying the second law of thermodynamics; local distribution of entropy production as well as the overall entropy produced in each component was determined. The analysis showed that entropy production is caused by two types of effects. One part results from real effects such as pressure drop and heat transfer; the other part is due to the  modeling assumptions made. Thus; the investigation of energy dissipation leads to a deeper understanding of the model.

The simulated amount of entropy produced is summarized in a record; so that the results can be read easily by other programs; e.g. programs that visualize energy and entropy flows. In the presented investigation the entropy flow and dissipation effects were analyzed by means of diagrams; such as Sankey diagrams.

The complete heat pump system has been simulated using the Modelica library TIL (TLK-IfT-Library) in order to determine the energy dissipation in each cycle component. With the modified TIL models; other process controls can also be investigated. This approach offers the opportunity to analyze the energy dissipation in detail; and differs in that sense from the commonly used technique of integrated energy balances and COP determinations.}

New classes compatible with the Modelica_Fluid library (beta 2) for these sub-processes are developed. A media model for

The different components are modeled individually and validated with measurement data in separate test benches. A co-simulation using one Dymola instance per component model is then created to represent the whole refrigeration cycle taking into account the inter-component dependencies.

To evaluate the effects introduced by the tool coupling; the results are compared to those of a single Modelica model composed of all component models.}

A first complex use case of the library represents the simulations-based design of a complex thermal energy supply system of a residential area; as a part of a newly built city in Iran.}

abstract = {Modeling of large fluid systems requires in-house (specialized) tools; since applicability of Modelica and existing environments is limited.

Nevertheless Modelica is a very powerful and descriptive modeling language; which is best suited for physical modeling in a heterogeneous environment. Its object oriented approach; the built-in documentation and the availability of commercial and free libraries justifies the decision for Modelica as the preferred modeling language within Siemens Energy.
 
For an appropriate analysis of transient power plant processes; there often are large fluid systems to be modeled; i.e. there can be several thousand states. For such plant models; we use our in-house tool Dynaplant (DP); which is specialized for large fluid systems. A comparison between DP and Dymola reveals some deficiencie s of the Modelica world concerning performance and plant model construction: Especially; successive initialization and sparse matrix solvers are important features in need.}

The developed real-time heliostat field simulator is basically the union of the hybrid heliostat field model and a wrapped model which handles the real-time simulation and communication issues between the heliostat field simulator and HelFiCo (Heliostat Field Control) software which is in charge of manipulating and controlling the heliostat field according to an automatic control strategy. The real-time heliostat field simulator provides a virtual system; with the same response as the real plant.}

This approach allows to define a “logical” model from which all different “real” controller configurations for Model-; Software-; Hardware-in-the-Loop (MiL; SiL; HiL); rapid prototyping; and production code for multi-processing/multi-tasking are automatically derived by setting configuration options. Furthermore; a new; free library - Modelica_EmbeddedSystems - is presented that provides a convenient user interface to the new language elements. In summary; the power of Modelica in the area of realtime control is improved significantly.}

On one hand just the knowledge about these different disciplines to approach and develop standalone-solutions is a big challenge where on the other hand the configuration and the control of the system routines are crucial steps. Nowadays most applications in process engineering are automated and digital signal processors (DSP) are widely used to implement control modules for different automatic control systems in an efficient and flexible way. Nevertheless; without dynamically applicable and real-time capable models it seems nearly impossible to estimate real operating conditions (e.g. controller parameter settings) in process engineering according to real requirements.

This paper presents the simulation model of a thermal control circuit for determining the distillation properties of petrochemical end products modeled in Modelica and performed by using the simulation tool Dymola. This simulation environment improves the design of interdisciplinary models and allows the optimization of the entire feedback loop.}

abstract = {There is a huge demand for heat storages for evaporation applications. Thermal storage systems are used to increase the efficiency of thermal systems by an improved adaption of energy availability and energy demand.

In this paper a possible solution for modular storage systems from 200-600 °C and pressures up to 100 bar is presented. The application of steam as a working medium requires the availability of isothermal storage if charging/discharging should take place at almost constant pressure. The saturation temperature range is between 200°C and 320°C. Therefore nitrate salts are used as phase change material (PCM). The solution developed at DLR is characterized by a modular concept of tube register storages surrounded by both sensible and latent heat storage material.

The focus in this paper is on modelling of the PCM storage. A model is introduced for melting and freezing of the PCM. To perform with an acceptable heat transfer rate inside the PCM; fins are used to increase the overall thermal conductivity. Instead introducing mean storage material parameters; like thermal conductivity or specific heat capacity; the geometry of the finned tube is modelled by using discrete elements. Therefore the model allows detailed studies on heat transfer during space and time. The fin design can be varied in order to find an optimal configuration. A set of partial differential equations is created and solved. When considering a stand alone system; that means tube; fin and PCM; without a connection to other components; investigation is quite effective. In case of the PCM storage there is the big advantage; compared with a sensible regenerator; that the almost constant fluid temperature; when evaporating or condensing; leads to a uniform temperature distribution in fluid flow direction. Therefore only a very rough discretisation in axial direction is needed; what even allows bonding with other components e.g. from the Modelica Fluid Library.

Sensible storages as they are used for preheating and superheating have a characteristic temperature gradient in axial direction. To describe their thermal behaviour concentrated models; using dimensionless numbers; are used.}

Standard heat storage systems do not work very efficiently with small supply temperature differences; because of the low sensible heat storage capacity. In contrast to the sensible heat storage a phase change material (PCM) storage system uses the phase change process to store energy at small temperature differences. In this paper a thermo hydraulic model of a PCM storage is developed and imple mented by using Modelica; so that dynamic modelling is possible. To show the advantages of latent heat storage (LHS) the PCM storage model has been combined to build a standard heat pump system model with a PCM storage instead of a sensible water storage and the overall system is analysed.}

When applying the accompanying library functions; one may create moderately complex thermal structures with non-uniform thermal properties.

abstract = {In this paper; Modelica along with Optimica is used to formulate and solve a minimum time optimization problem. The problem concerns the traversal of a given path with a robot in as short time as possible under input constraints. Several problem reformulations; increasing the chance of finding optimal solutions; are discussed. This paper also discusses the use of these optimal solutions for control of industrial robots. A control structure; in which the optimal trajectories are essential; is used on an ABB IRB140B to ensure robustness for model errors and disturbances.}

abstract = {Dynamic optimization addresses the problem of finding the minimum of a cost function subject to a constraint comprised of a system of differential equations. There are many algorithms to numerically solve such optimization problems. One such algorithm is multiple shooting. This paper reports an implementation of a multiple shooting algorithm in Python. The implementation is based on the open source platform JModelica. org; the integrator SUNDIALS and the optimization algorithm scipy_slsqp. The JModelica.org platform supports model descriptions encoded in the Modelica language and optimization specifications expressed in the extension Optimica. The Modelica/Optimica combination provides simple means to express complex optimization problems in a compact and useroriented manner. The JModelica.org platform in turn translates the high-level descriptions into efficient C code which can compiled and linked with Python. As a result; the numerical packages available for Python can be used to develop custom applications based on Modelica/Optimica specifications. An example is provided to illustrate the capabilities of the method.}

abstract = {The vehicle response of construction machines strongly depends on the tuning of the control system in interaction with the drive system. A compromise between performance and comfort needs to be found to fulfill the operators requirements on a high usability of the machine. In order to achieve an optimal behavior Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation techniques offer a suitable approach to determine the overall behavior in advance. Prerequisition is a realtime capable simulation model of the considered system. Therefore; in this paper the mathematical model of the system is automatically adapted by symbolic model reduction algorithms in order to match real-time requirements on a given hardware. Inputs to the automatic reduction algorithm are the complex mathematical system model; the desired realtime cycle and the number of floating operations per second (flops); which can be realized by the chosen target hardware. The outputs of the algorithm are the automatically reduced model; which is guaranteed to run in realtime on the target hardware and the maximal model error for the test scenario. In this paper; the reduction procedure is demonstrated for the complex hydromechanical model of a so-called kid steer loader. Summarizing; the proposed procedure of symbolic model reduction helps to reduce the developing phase of mechatronic prototypes dramatically as the adaptation of the system model with respect to the target hardware is completely automated.}

With the introduction of new templates and standard components; Modelica has become increasingly accessible for researchers and students in the field of vehicle dynamics and therefore a project was initiated to evaluate its usefulness as an educational tool. The general idea is to introduce Dymola in smaller assignments; aiming to familiarise the students with the basic functions of the tool while demonstrating its use through simulation examples. Four exercises were studied: a truck braking system model; a friction disc clutch model; a controllable torque clutch model and a combined driver and vehicle model. The conclusions from this pilot study were that Dymola offers several ways to enhance the quality of vehicle engineering education; mainly due to the ease of modelling and the rich animation functions which make the simulation exercises more interesting.}

A generic solution is presented; which analyses existing Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) documents and thereof automatically generates simulation models. They are described as Modelica models and use a special library; customized for the automation branch. It contains common elements which can be parameterized with very few efforts. Additional components for the communication to the control are available. They support several widely accepted technologies like OPC; Profibus; Profinet; analog and digital signals.

The generation process focuses on being as automated as possible. It is a general approach; which could be applied to various types of simulation with different levels of detail. Its integration into a software prototype shows the feasibility and provides first practical feedback.}

abstract = {Dimensional analysis and physical unit checking are important tools for helping users to detect and correct mistakes in dynamic mathematical models. To make tools useful in a broad range of domains; it is important to also support other units than the SI standard. For instance; such units are common in biochemical or financial modeling. Furthermore; if two or more units turn out be in conflict after checking; it is vital that the reported unit information is given in an understandable format for the user; e.g.; “N.m” should preferably be shown instead of “m2.kg.s-2”; even if they represent the same unit. Presently; there is no standardized solution to handle these problems for Modelica models. The contribution presented in this paper is twofold. Firstly; we propose an extension to the Modelica language that makes it possible for a library designer to define both new base units and derived units within Modelica models and packets. Today this information is implicitly defined in the specification. Secondly; we describe and analyze a solution to the problem of presenting units to users in a more convenient way; based on an algorithm using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). Both solutions are implemented; tested; and illustrated with several examples.}
