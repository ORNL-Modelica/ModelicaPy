abstract = {Different simulation and modeling tools often use their own definition of how a model is represented and how model data is stored. Complications arise when trying to model parts in one tool and importing the resulting model in another tool or when trying to verify a result by using a different simulation tool. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a standard to provide a unified model execution interface. In this paper we present an implementation of the FMI specification in the JModelica.org platform; where support for import and export of FMI compliant models has been added. The JModelica.org FMI import interface is written in Python and offers a complete mapping of the FMI C API. JModelica.org also offers a set of Pythonic convenience methods for interacting with the model in an object-oriented manner. In addition; a connection to the simulation environment Assimulo which is part of JModelica.org is offered to allow for simulation of models following the FMI specification using state of the art numerical integrators. Generation of FMI compliant models from JModelica.org will also be discussed.}

Conventional VCS clients and diff tools cannot inform the user what the effect of a single edit has on the model as a whole. Converge compares selected revisions of a model; loading the Modelica code directly from the VCS repository. This paper presents examples of Modelica code where an edit that appears significant in a conventional diff tool can be shown as not so; and an edit that appears insignificant in a conventional diff tool actually has significant changes to the resulting model.

Successfully comparing two revisions of a model requires resolving the types of components; including handling inheritance; imports and redeclarations. It requires handling of equations and component values; and flattening of the model structure.

Converge includes a complete Modelica implementation; and presents the VCS repository to the user with a number of views; including Packages; Inheritance; Dependencies; Annotations; and Components views; and Instance and Equations views that compare the instantiated model. Changes; and whether they affect the model results; are highlighted to the user. This will allow users to understand the development of models over time and to solve problems caused by changes in dependent Modelica libraries.}

The user is intended to perform simula-tion runs; to inspect results; to change selected parameters within given bounds; but not to inspect or even change the model itself.

The reasons for such a usage scenario are manifold: The simulation is intended to be used as a black-box tool by non simulation specialists; a component vendor (electric drives; pneumatic or hydraulic components; etc.) likes to demonstrate the performance of his components in the context of a simulation or the model developer may hide model details.

If a model development tool includes code generation the model specific simulator can be setup fully automatic. However; a GUI (graphical user interface) for such a simulator must be developed manually. We developed a tool which automatically generates a simulator GUI from a Modelica model and data definition.}

Such extrinsic and intrinsic disturbances can be compensated by active control of optical elements like lenses; diffraction gratings or laser sources. In the context with system design and performance analysis tasks it is big challenge to model and simulate the coupled optomechatronic behavior including closed-loop control and disturbances properly on a representative level.

A promising approach is the integration of diffractive optic models in the well established physical object oriented modeling environment Modelica<sup>®</sup>; which offers already a broad support of multidomain libraries; e.g. electrical; mechanical and thermal.

Therefore the basic modeling requirements for diffractive optical elements are outlined followed by a discussion of possible problems and solutions for a computationally efficient implementation of a twodimensional spatial <em>optical library</em> for Modelicabased simulation environments.}

The discrete parts of hybrid systems may suffer from the same problem as observed in synchronous programs. As we recently extended our synchronous language Quartz to describe hybrid systems; we explain in this paper how the causality analysis as originally introduced for synchronous systems can also be used to handle cyclic dependencies in hybrid Modelica programs.}

Furthermore; we have carried out comparisons with ACADO; which is a multiple shooting package for solving optimal control problems.

CasADi; in turn; has been interfaced with ACADO Toolkit; enabling users to define optimal control problems using Modelica and Optimica specifications; and use solve using direct multiple shooting. In addition; a collocation algorithm targeted at solving largescale DAE constrained dynamic optimization problems has been implemented. This implementation explores CasADi’s Python and IPOPT interfaces; which offer a convenient; yet highly efficient environment for development of optimization algorithms. The algorithms are evaluated using industrially relevant benchmark problems.}

This paper presents an approach to increase the customisability; access; and reuse of symbolic optimisation by a more modular and flexible design concept. An overview of the common symbolic manipulation and optimisation algorithms of a typical Modelica compiler is presented as well as a general modular design concept for a Modelica compiler backend. The modularisation concept will be implemented in a future version of the OpenModelica compiler.}

In order to allow a complete integration of this continuously fluctuating energy source; it is necessary to have a highly flexible operation management as well as power stations which are able to follow the high dynamics of the wind power production.

In this context the component fatigue and operational limitations of current and future power stations have to be investigated under the influence of enhanced plant dynamics.

For this purpose a detailed Modelica model of the hard coal fired steam power plant of Rostock; Germany is presented and extensively validated. The model makes use of the well-known non-commercial library ThermoPower. This Modelica Library is extended by models for common solid fuel burners and radiation-dominated firing zones. In addition to this; different approaches for modeling two-phase containers like the feed water tank are discussed. The derived model is used to compare different operation modes with respect to the occurring component wear.}

To that end; the library contains over 100 0D/1D model components such as heat exchangers; steam and gas turbines; compressors; pumps; drums; tanks; volumes; valves; pipes; furnaces; combustion chambers; etc. In particular; one and two-phase water/steam flow; as well as flue gases flow are handled.

The library has been validated against several testcases belonging to all the main domains of power plant modeling; namely the nuclear; thermal; biomass and solar domains.

The paper describes first the structure library. Then the test-case belonging to the thermal domain is presented. It is the dynamic model of a combined cycle power plant; whose objective is to study a step variation load from 100% to 50% and a full gas turbine trip. The structure of the model; the parameterization data; the results of simulation runs and the difficulties encountered are presented.}

abstract = {The majority of industrial controlled induction machine drives are connected to the mains via a diode bridge. However; if reduction of harmonic currents and / or regenerative operation is desired; replacing the diode bridge by an active front-end (AFE) is required. This paper describes two models of an AFE: a power balance model disregarding switching effects; and an ideal switching model of a pulse width modulation (PWM) converter. Both models are controlled utilizing space phasors in a voltage oriented reference frame. Voltage oriented control (VOC) of the mains converter can be compared with field oriented control (FOC) of a machine converter. Design and parametrization of the main parts—synchronization with mains voltage; current controller and DC voltage controller—are described in detail. Additionally; simulation results proving the implementation and demonstrating possible investigations as well as an outlook on further enhancements are presented.}

keywords = {},
abstract = {Today; neutral compensation based on Petersen coils is being applied in many MV electrical networks. The main reasons for this are :

<ul>
  <li>an important expansion of the underground net-work in rural environment. This leads to high phase-to-ground capacities of the outgoing feeders; which increases fault currents in networks using impedant grounding;</li>
  <li>an increased sensitivity of the customers to the quality of supply;</li>
  <li>changes in international standards (insulation coordination).</li>
</ul>

The introduction of arc suppression Petersen coils allows both to reduce the current in single phase-to-ground faults and to improve the quality of supply by reducing short supply disconnection.

Adapting this solution to the existing networks made it necessary to change the protection system; by using zero sequence wattmetric relays.

The feedbacks of the zero sequence wattmetric relays operating today show the need of an evolution of this protection equipment specifications. To address this need; EDF R&D has investigated the use of Modelica language for the electrical system modeling.

At first the relevance of Modelica language for electrical systems modeling has been studied. This work was made from a comparison of simulation results with those traditionally obtained with EMTP software; normally used by EDF R&D. This paper details this approach and underlines the interest of Modelica for the electrical network fields. The next step will be the use of the ModelicaML profile in order to establish a new version of the protection system specification.}

Coupling between Dynaplant and a Modelica-simulator helps to benefit in addition from the possibility of rapid development of new components in Modelica.

Here; it is shown; how the Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) export from a Modelica model can be used to perform a co-simulation with Dynaplant and an FMU simulator.

This paper reports on the first bootstrapping (i.e.; a compiler can compile itself) of a full-scale EOO (Equation-based Object-Oriented) modeling language such as Modelica. The Modelica language has been modeled/implemented in the OpenModelica compiler (OMC) using an extended version of Modelica called MetaModelica. OMC models the MetaModelica language and is now compiling itself with good performance. Benefits include a more extensible maintainable compiler; also making it easier to add functionality such as debugging support.

This work is in line with the recently started Modelica 4 design effort which includes moving implementation of language features from the compiler to a Modelica Core library; allowing compilers to become smaller while increasing correctness and portability.

A number of language constructs discussed for Modelica 4 are already supported in some form by the bootstrapped compiler. Future work includes adapting language constructs according to the Modelica 4 design effort and extracting and restructuring parts of the Modelica implementation from the OMC compiler to instead reside in a Modelica Core library; making the compiler smaller and more extensible.}

By defining a languages grammar; an editor that provides basic support for developers can be generated automatically. This paper describes how these concepts are utilized for the creation of a Modelica Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Helpful functionality is implemented in a model driven way to maximize assistance during the development process. Thus the developer receives a tool that allows to survey large scale projects and provides functionality that is well known in other popular programming languages. Furthermore an approach for semantical verification of Modelica documents during the development process is presented. This allows to detect and correct errors early.}

To prepare a simulation model for execution on a real-time target; an experienced developer usually performs several adaptations on the model and the solver in order to reduce runtime and communication needs.

Two-folded tool support for evaluating the effect of such adaptations is presented here: (1) A ModelComparator for the systematic comparison of simulation results from different versions of the model and (2) an RT-Profiler for measurements and analyses of function calls during RT simulations. The ModelComparator facilitates verification of a model adapted for real-time execution to ensure that it will produce sufficiently accurate results at selected operation points. The RTProfiler takes the specific code structure of simulation models into account when measuring execution times. It directs the developer to those parts that are most promising for model adaptations.

We consider OpenModelica and SimulationX as modeling and code generation frameworks for realtime simulation. The procedure of model adaptations and the use of the analysis tools therein are exemplified in small case studies.}

The influence of uncertain measurements on the behavior of the system must be assessed; for safety reasons for instance. Also; by combining information given by physical models and sensor measurements; the accuracy of the knowledge of the state of the system can be improved; leading to better plant monitoring and maintenance.

Three well established techniques for handling uncertainties using physical models are presented: data reconciliation; propagation of uncertainties and interpolation techniques. Then; the requirements for handling these techniques in Modelica environments are given. They apply to the Modelica language itself: how to specify the uncertainty problem to be solved directly in the Modelica model. They also apply to model processing: what are the pieces of information that must be automatically extracted from the model and provided to the standard algorithms that compute the uncertainties.

Modelica language extensions in terms of two new pre-defined attributes; uncertain and distribution; are introduced for Real and Integer variables. This is needed to differentiate between certain (the usual kind) variables and uncertain variables which have associated probability distributions. An algorithm for extracting from the Modelica model the auxiliary conditions needed by the data reconciliation algorithm is given. These new features have been partially implemented in the MathModelica tool (and soon OpenModelica).}

abstract = {Modelica enables rapid development of detailed models of heterogeneous and complex systems. However; resulting models are as complicated as reality itself and therefore it may be hard to identify causes for model behavior or verify that model behaves correctly. A traditional engineering approach is to use intuition and experience to identify important parts of the model with the highest impact on model behavior for specific scenario. Numerous model order reduction and simplification techniques (i.e.; metrics used by these methods) have been developed to automatically estimate important parts of the models for a certain scenario and thus alleviate reliance on subjective factors; i.e.; intuition and past experience.

In this paper are discussed model order reduction and simplification techniques (e.g.; metrics used by these techniques for rankings of elements) which are applicable to wide range of Modelica models built from already available libraries. Modelica models are translated to set of differential-algebraic equations and for the latter there are numerous tools for model order reduction already available. However; these tools are not designed for helping users understand the model’s behavior and the reduced model may be hard to understand by the user because the structure of the original model is lost. Hierarchical decomposition of the model must be presereved and if the model is developed with a graphical schematics then elements (nodes) of the schematics must be ranked. Therefore we adapted energy-based metrics used in ranking of bond-graphs’ elements to much more losely defined Modelica’s schematics; so they can be used complementary with ranking methods that work with equations.}

One of basic premises of creating bipartite graph is to determine types of variables and equations. Type calculation of Modelica equation has been researched and a serial of rules for variability and type calculation has been concluded in this paper.

Equation type is the type of variable that equation can solve. Equation type is calculated in symbolic by both variability and basic type of its sub-expressions. Generally; type calculation is a bottom-up way as expression is represented in form of tree. But; there are kinds of particular expressions; such as integer(); noEvent(); multi-output function call expression; etc; which may cause type and variability incompatible problem. The issue is discussed in the paper; and several rules for variability and type calculation are present. These rules will helps to debug out obscure errors; and several typical examples are present to show how the rules work.}

abstract = {The presented work depicting the integrated modelling of probabilistic occupant behaviour in buildings consists of non-physical modelling with a physical multidomain impact. The human behaviour considering occupancy; the use of lighting and the use of electric appliances in dwellings has been implemented; but the same method can be used for other stochastic behaviour. The stochastic behaviour is used for simulation of coupled thermal and electrical systems in the building stock and is of high importance for the assessment of smart grids and distributed energy generation. Implementing stochastic occupant behaviour influences the internal heat gains which in turn influence the heat load of the building and the switch-on and -off moment of e.g. an electric heat pump. This; together with the power demand of the used electric appliances and possible on-site generation determine the load on the electric grid and possible instabilities. Here; the use of deterministic profiles for use at both the building and the building district scale no longer fits.

Comparison between a determinsitic approach as proposed in ISO 13790 and the use stochastic profiles shows that the direct first order effect is on average rather small: the difference in total internal gains and its influence on the indoor temperature averages nearly zero and the standard deviations  are small; however high peaks may occur. Also the difference in effect on the electric distribution grid voltage averages nearly zero; however here strong peaks occur which are of most importance for the grid stability. When taking in account the second order effect of heating by means of electricity; much larger differences are noticed: due to longer and more differentiated occupancy times; the average indoor temperature rises. Furthermore; the moment of heating differentiates compared to a determinsitic approach resulting in more but smaller peak demands towards the electricity grid.}

Basically a power producer gets punished if his production deviates from the scheduled production. The power plant is paid for the actual production: if too much power is produced that the price for the excess power is low. Even worse if too little power is produced the power plant has to pay a fine. If such deviation occurs it is very important to identify components/systems that are responsible in order to adjust the controller or replace the faulty equipment. This paper describes the first step in problem solving; by presenting the development of a model of a hydro power plant that shows differing power production. The modelling part was done in Modelica<sup>®</sup> using HydroPlant Libra of Modelon AB. The model was parametrised using construction data and validated usindata from test and operation runs.}

Minimizing the energy demand for carbon dioxide removal under these circumstances reduces the cost disadvantage of carbon capture compared to conventional production. In this work a dynamic model in Modelica of a chemical absorption process run with an aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) is developed; and used for solving optimal control problems. Starting from a rather detailed dynamic model of the process; model reduction is performed based on physical insight. The reduced model computes distinctly faster; shows similar transient behavior and reflects trends for optimal steady-state operations reported in the literature. The detailed model has been developed in Dymola; and the reduced model is used in JModelica. org; a platform supporting non-linear dynamic optimization. First results are shown on the dynamic optimization of the desorption column; the main cause of energy usage in the process.}

With this strategy; a new media model can be introduced by changing the components information of mixture and of mixing rule. An air distillation column model was built to test the air media model consists of nitrogen; oxygen and argon. The results obtained with Mworks were compared with simulation calculated with Aspen Plus. A very good agreement was found and the air model for distillation in the column worked well.}

Several Petri net components are structured within an advanced Petri net library. A special sub library contains so-called wrappers for specific biological reac-tions to simplify the modeling procedure.

The Petri net models developed with the Dymola tool can be connected to Matlab Simulink to use all the Matlab power for parameter identification; sensitivity analysis and stochastic simulation.

This paper illustrates the usage of the Petri net library; the coupling to Matlab Simulink and further processing of the simulation results with algorithms in Matlab. In addition; the application is demonstrated by modeling the metabolism of Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells.}

These steps are carried out by the engineer manually for the many different plant-controller configurations available in the organization. This repetitive workflow provides significant opportunities to streamline and automate the model based development process and improve productivity.

This paper presents an in-house MATLAB<sup>®</sup> GUI tool that can be used to configure the plant; select the controller; automatically generate an integrated model with the plant and controller; and simulate the resulting model. The plant model configuration information is passed on to Dymola<sup>®</sup> (the simulation environment) using the available communication (COM or DDE) to generate the plant model S-function. This tool includes post processing capabilities such as plotting the simulation results and custom plotting of metrics that are generated postsimulation.}

In a master-slave concept the slaves simulate sub-problems whereas the master is responsible for both coordinating the overall simulation as well as transferring data. To unify the interface between master and slave the FMI for Co-Simulation was developed. Using FMI a master was implemented with simple and advanced algorithms which can be applied depending on the properties of the involved slave simulators. The master was tested amongst others by coupling with SimulationX.}

In order to extend the capabilities of the DLR FlexibleBodies library for such use cases; a new Modelica class has been implemented which is based on the analytical description of an annular Kirchhoff plate. In addition the so-called Arbitray Langrangian-Eulerian (ALE) representation has been adopted so that rotating and non-rotating external loads may be applied conventiently to rotating plates.

Besides these particularities the new class AnnularPlate completely corresponds to the concept of FlexibleBodies library with the two already available model classes Beam and ModalBody.

This paper gives an overview on the theoretical background of the new class AnnularPlate; explains the usage and presents application examples.}

Essentially; the prediction of refrigerant charge inside the evaporator is crucial for the dynamic behavior. The prediction of refrigerant charge follows from suitable void fraction correlations from the literature. A chosen set of void fraction correlations (slip flow) and the assumption of homogeneous flow will be investigated in this paper and compared to experiments on a simple coaxial type evaporator. The numerical model of the evaporator is a dynamic distributed mixture model; where different void fraction correlations can be applied. It is shown that the dynamic response of the homogeneous model is too fast; whereas the slip flow models agree well with the experiments. Another difference is that the charge prediction of the homogeneous model is approximately 2-3 times less than the slip flow models.}

For this purpose; the hot water storage model is simulated with ANSYS CFD. This detailed sub-model is embedded in the solar thermal system model; which consists of component models of the Modelica library FluidFlow and is simulated with Dymola. The numerical coupling and integration of both sub-models is realized by the use of the co-simulation environment TISC. With a comparison of a pure Modelica system model and a mixed 1D / 3D system model of the same solar thermal system; advantages and disadvantages of both simulation approaches are worked out.}

This tire model is available for most multi-body simulation programs like ADAMS; Sim-Pack; RecurDyn and for MATLAB. But up to now it was not available in the odelica world. As the Ftire model is only available as binary libraries it could not be ported to a pure Modelica code; but an interface to the existing implementation had to be written. This paper describes the implementation of FTire package making FTire tires available in Modelica (so this paper is rather about interfacing than about tire modeling). The interface involves much more than just a set of Modelica wrappers to C functions: Most callable FTire functions are impure; some having only side effects; no return values. Some considerations have to be taken to ensure the FTire functions are called just often enough. Above this basic Modelica interface layer there is an embedding into the Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody framework with some features beyond FTire itself like non-standard orientation or common definitions for several tires.

The moreover there are some related packages for special interests: The FTireVDL demonstrates the compatibility of the FTire interface to the Vehicle-Dynamics package from Modelon. Users of the Visualization package from DLR-RM can apply the FTireSimVis package to animate multi-body models with FTire wheels with the SimVis program; exceeding the animation capabilities of Dymola.}

At the same time dynamical models of the bodies involved; gearwheels and gearbox housing; continue to be three-dimensional. Analytical computational procedures to obtain gradients and Hessians are constructed for implementing the contact tracking algorithm for the involute guided cylindrical surfaces. The known Johnson model is applied for computing the contact elastic normal force. This force is defined as an implicit function of the mutual penetration depth at contact. Regular algorithm to compute the normal elastic force is built up. This algorithm is proved to be convergent. A detailed analysis of the virtual setup dynamic model is carried out.}

The CVs take in fluid from the inlet port and squeeze fluid out at the outlet port. The whole model of the pump also takes into account flow ripple; pressure distribution; leakages; meshing conditions; etc. Details of each component of the whole pump are provided.

However; the dynamic mathematic model of air brake system is very complicate; which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper; the components of air brake system are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components; and then build the system based on these basic standard pneu-matic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-Mworks based on Modelica language include cylinder; nozzle; air reservoir; volume; and air pipe. An air brake system which contains brake valve; relay valve; brake chambers and pipelines is made based on the standard pneumatic components. The simulation results show the dynamic characteristics of air brake system.}

It is an extension of the classical Transmission Line Model (TLM); a transfer matrix representation of a pipeline; relating pressure and volume flow rates at the extremities of a pipeline. The proposed model has extended previous work in different aspects. The extensions were developed for the detailed operational investigation of a pipeline for the transport of carbon dioxide from a carbon capture plant to a suitable location for the geological storage of supercritical; dense phase carbon dioxide. A lumped temperature model; derived as the TLM model by integrating the distributed dynamics; has been added to describe the effect of heat losses in long pipelines. A dynamic friction model that is explicit in the medium and pipeline characterisitcs has also been included. Finally; it is shown that; with simple adjustments; the model can reasonably well describe the pressure dynamics in turbulent flow conditions. Some simulations have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed model to the one from theModelica Standard Library; and the results were also compared to measurement results from the literature. The resulting model has become useful for a wide variety of engineering applications: pipelines for gas and oil; district heating networks; water distribution networks; wastewater systems; hydro power plants and more. In the lumped; constant temperature version; there are no discretization artifacts; and even in the discretized version taking into account spatial and temporal changes in temperature; discretization artifacts are much smaller than for the standard finite volume model. Moreover; the short simulation times make the model suitable for real-time applications.}

However; the industrial usage of these tools seems to be very limited so far. De-spite this fact; fluid modeling is possible if restrictions are taken into account.

In this contribution; we propose to use benchmark models for the systematic investigation of the accuracy and the performance of Modelica OS tools. The present implementation circumvents the limitations of OpenModelica making it possible to simulate the model system despite existing restrictions. Beside simulation tasks Modelica-based optimization is possible using the OS tool JModelica. However; care must be taken with respect to the model features. In particular instantaneous transitions within the system dynamics; such as phase transitions; switching of valves with discrete behaviour or flow reversal represent a severe obstacle for optimization. In this article; we present a parameter estimation problem including instantaneous changes of the flow direction. In addition; an example of model predictive control (MPC) for a control task difficult to solve with con-ventional methods is shown.}

On the other hand; technical systems are subject to signs of wear and tear which are in general growing slowly and imperceptibly. The gradual abrasion of applied tools may lead to poor production tolerances or to a component’s standstill. Hence; a condition-based maintenance strategy will be of increasing importance. Such a strategy requires a permanent condition monitoring during operation. To this end; reliable high-performance algorithms for signal processing; feature extraction; and classification are needed. Modeling the process of wear and tear may be useful to find the particular steps of the condition monitoring system’s signal processing. This strategy was investigated by means of one very important device from automation engineering; a hydraulic axial piston pump. The procedure of getting signals by an appropriate Modelica model of the main parts of the pump is shown within the paper. Additionally; the manipulation process for the signals and the steps of classification are shortly presented to give an overview to the possibilities of model-based signal generation based on a Modelica model. The advantages of the multi-physics modeling language are emphasized because the axial piston pump model combines the mechanical and the hydraulic domain in a very efficient way.}

The library of a vehicle model with a highly det hydromechanical clutch is introduced; which includes models with different levels of detail. The modeling of the hydraulic and the mechanic parts of the clutch actuator is discussed; concentrating on the problem of determining the parameters of the actuator modules e.g.; the hydraulic valves. Some parts could not be used from existing Dymola<sup>®</sup> libraries; in those cases; new models are created based on Modelica code.}

Once central aspect is the use of nonlinear observers for several modules. A generic concept was developed and implemented in a prototype to automatically generate a nonlinear observer model in Modelica; given a contiuous (usually nonlinear) Modelica model of the physical system to be observed. The approach is based on the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI); by exporting the model in FMI format and importing it again in a form that enables the application of different observer designs; like EKF and UKF nonlinear Kalman Filters. The approach is demonstrated at  hand of an observer for nonlinear battery model of the elctric vehicle of DLR.}

The term “property” is intended here to be generic and refers to a system requirement or limitation as well as a validity domain of a model. The choice of the Modelica language is justified by a desire to use its equation-based feature to model system properties in an unambiguous and explicit way. Besides; choosing only one   formalism to describe the system properties and the physical equations of the model should ease the expression of the model validity domains. 

After having introduced several theoretical concepts to formally describe a system property; the development of a dedicated library is explained and illustrated on an industrial example taken from the aeronautics domain. Some checks of system properties are thus performed by co-simulating behavioral and properties models. Finally; some extensions of the Modelica language are advocated in order to improve the applicability range and efficiency of properties modeling for complex systems; and especially to increase the rigor of their validations by enabling formal proofs.}

abstract = {In this study a dynamic model of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system has been developed. The work has been conducted in a cooperation between the Department of Energy Sciences; Lund University; and Modelon AB using the Modelica language and the Dymola modeling and simulation tool. The objective of the study is to investigate the suitability  of the Modelica language for dynamic fuel cell system modeling.

Fuel cell system modeling requires a flexible modeling tool that can handle electronics; chemistry; thermodynamics and the interaction between these. The core of the fuel cell is the electrolyte and the electrodes. The cell voltage generated depends on the fluid molar compositions in the anode and cathode channels. The internal resistance varies depending on several cell properties. The electrical current through the cell varies over the cell area and is coupled to the rate of the chemical reactions taking place on the electrode surface. Other parts of the system that is also included in the model are pre-processing of the fuel; combustion of the fuel remaining after passing through the cell and heat recovery from the exhaust gas.

A cell electrolyte model including ohmic; activation and concentration irreversibilities is implemented and verified against simulations and experimental data presented in the open literature. A 1D solid oxide fuel cell model is created by integrating the electrolyte model and a 1D fuel flow model; which includes dynamic internal steam reforming of methane and water-gas shift reactions. Several cells are then placed with parallel flow paths and connected thermally and electrically in series. By introducing a manifold pressure drop; a stack model is created. This stack model is applied in a complete fuel cell system model including an autothermal reformer; a catalytic afterburner; a steam generator and heat exchangers. Four reactions are modeled in the autothermal reformer; two types of methane steam reforming; the water-gas shift reaction and total combustion of methane. Several simulations of systems and individual components have been performed; and when possible been compared with results in the literature. It can be concluded that the models are accurate and that Dymola and Modelica are tools well suited for simulations of the observed transient fuel cell system behaviour.}

The model components are designed as an extension of SiemensPower; a Modelica library for transient simulation of power plants.

The focus is on coal combustion; gas-particle-flow and radiation heat transfer in the furnace. The dispersed flow of flue gas has to be modeled because radiation heat transfer gets considerably intensified by the contained coal and ash particles. Customized connectors for the dispersed flow of flue gas had to be developed on the base of Modelica.Fluid.

The component oriented approach supports the adaption of the model to different simulation tasks; such as stability analysis of the evaporator or influence of the coal mill on plant dynamics. Component structure; parametrization and spatial discretization were important aspects for the development of maintainable and re-usable components of the model library.}

The recent trend towards a broader use of electric system technologies on commercial aircraft has motivated the creation of this kind of model library; which supports the conceptual design and optimisation of on-board electrical systems regarding power behaviour; weight; reliability and safety.}

But inconsistencies in the requirements definition and misinterpretations will lead to errors in the program which have to be resolved through expensive software-in-the-loop and field tests. This paper introduces a holistic 
approach for the formalisation of the control design already in the design phase. It also illustrates the design flow for the model-based creation of error-free control programs. Created by means of graphical editors the system definition; which includes the control algorithm; is transferred into Modelica code and thus the executable system model is used for the simulation-based verification. The simulation results are compared to the requirements. Once these are fulfilled and no further errors found; program code for the real-time controller is generated automatically. In this paper Structured Text for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) according to IEC 61131 is generated. In final software-in-the-loop tests the real-time capabilities of the control program are validated.}

In this paper; we present minimal examples of models that exhibit unexpected or surprising results; then we explain the general causes of such behaviors and propose to introduce the notion of clock in the language to solve the issues. In contrast to [1] and [2]; we focus here on models resulting from the composition of other models: we aim at showing that the current discrete-time theoretical model of Modelica is not robust with respect to model composition. For the final user; it means that it is generally not possible to build reliable models involving discrete-time aspects by simply connecting generic library models: manual adjustments are often required to obtain the expected behavior.}

The approaches are based on different ideas and cover different aspects of the interaction of modern simulation tools. For that reason different constraints have to be considered; which do not make things easier. Both principles have advantages and disadvantages. However; by combining both ways; a powerful framework for handling a broad variety of simulation tasks can be formed.

CarMaker is provided an interface which allows for vehicle models being extended by almost arbitrary external component models implementing the FMI. The FMI offers two flavors of units which permit the balancing of computational performance and numerical robustness within CarMaker. Additional model information provided by the FMI is used for automatic integration of the external models as well as for configuring the computations. Involved aspects are shown by an example truck model.}

abstract = {The TNO Delft-Tyre is a renowned model for the pneumatic tire in the automotive industry based upon the famous Magic Formula first introduced by Bakker et.al. in the late eighties. The name Magic Formula seems to appear first at the 1<sup>st</sup> Delft colloquium on tires four years later. The Magic Formulae themselves have evolved greatly during the last two decades with contributions from a wide variety of companies and researchers.

The Magic Formula is widely used in the automotive (and gaming) industry because of its ease of use to represent the complicated tire characteristics.

TNO has marketed the Magic Formula tire model as Delft-Tyre and implemented the dynamic forces and moments computation routines; including the extension of SWIFT; in a variety of multibody simulation packages; like ADAMS and DADS and general purpose simulation software Simulink.

Modelon has in close cooperation with TNO by means of extensive benchmarks implemented the MF-Tyre/MF-Swift in Modelica. This paper presents the work conducted to implement the TNO tire models in Modelica which now is available as a commercial library in Dymola.}

abstract = {In future cars; battery electric and hybrid electric drives will increasingly appear. Subsystems like e.g. the steering system and the braking system will accordingly be based on electric power supply. This leads to new challenges as well as opportunities also in the field of vehicle dynamics and an increased need of multidomain simulation concepts that combine multibody-based vehicle dynamics models and models of the electric and control systems. This paper includes a simulation study of the Audi sports car e-tron with electric power steering system using the Vehicle Dynamics Library from Modelon AB Sweden to model chassis and suspensions and the Modelica Standard Library to model the electric power steering system. The steering system controller unit was modeled alternatively in the Modelica Standard Library and in Matlab Simulink. Dymola and Matlab Simulink have alternatively been used as simulation environments whereas a special focus was put on different ways to integrate these tools according to standard development processes in the automotive industry. Additionally; extensive validation work was invested to compare vehicle dynamics results generated with ADAMS/Car and the Vehicle Dynamics Library.}

Two example calculations show how the simulation speed can be increased by choosing the right way to set up the equations. One example refers to the ordering of the substances in the substance vector and one refers to the modelling of equilibrium processes. An example of use presented is the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption in a post-combustion carbon capture plant. The transient simulation results are compared to measurement data obtained in a Siemens pilot plant.}

Such an analysis has to account for heterogeneous phenomena efficiently; to manage components in a modular manner; and (which is seldom addressed in a structured way) to scale the detail level in all or part of the model; based on the particular simulation goal. In this manuscript; a proposal is formulated on how to structure a Modelica library so as to satisfy such a need.}
