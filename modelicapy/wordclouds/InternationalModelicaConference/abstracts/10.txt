abstract = {This paper focuses on the physical design of hydraulic relief and servo valves and its applications. Specifically; this paper serves to illustrate how the physical design parameters of hydraulic components can be incorporated into system modeling and their effect on the system dynamics and stability characteristics. Detailed physical models of a relief valve and a servo valve developed using the Hydraulics Library® are discussed in this paper with particular emphasis on the effect of design parameters on the stability characteristics. A simple design of experiment (DoE) to illustrate robust design methods for hydraulic system design is also shown with the use of the FMI Toolbox (FMIT) (FMIT) for MATLAB®.  . Furthermore with the help of these two valve models; we seek to bring to the attention of the community; an important limitation in open loop controls analysis in an acausal modeling environment where the feedback loops are embedded in the physics of the model.

abstract = {Feedforward control based on inverse dynamic plant models (linear or nonlinear) is a suitable method to enhance set-point tracking performance of control systems. In reality actuators always have limits; but limiting functions can not be inverted. A common approach to handle this issue is to invert the unlimited plant model and detune the feedforward filter in order to stay always in between the actuator limits. This approach causes a loss in performance for rapid set-point changes; because the actuator range is not entirely used. In this article a rather simple but powerful method is presented; which overcomes this performance issue for many types of plant models. Actuator limits are fully exploited; and the obtained trajectories are close to optimal ones. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate the usability of the proposed feedforward structure.}

abstract = {A computational framework for the efficient analysis and optimization of dynamic hybrid energy systems(HES) is developed. A microgrid energy system with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO)is modeled using the Modelica language in the Dymola environment. The optimization loop is implemented in MATLAB; with the FMI Toolbox serving as the interface between the computational platforms. Two characteristic optimization problems are selected to demonstrate the methodology and gain insight into the system performance. The first is an unconstrained optimization problem that optimizes intrinsic properties of the base generation; power cycle; and electrical storage components to minimize variability in the HES. The second problem takes operating and capital costs into consideration by imposing linear and nonlinear constraints on the design variables. Variability in electrical power applied to high temperature steam electrolysis is shown to be reduced by 18% in the unconstrained case and 11% in the constrained case. The preliminary optimization results obtained in this study provide an essential step towards the development of a comprehensive framework for designing HES.}

abstract = {Concepts such as smart grids; distributed generation and micro–generation of energy; market–driven as well as demand–side energy management; are becoming increasingly important and relevant as emerging trends in the design; management and control of energy systems. Appropriate modeling and design; efficient management and control strategies of such systems are currently being studied. In this line of research a very important enabling component is efficient and reliable simulation. However those energy models are typically large; stiff and exhibiting heavy discontinuities; and at the same time consist of interconnected multi–domain subsystems encompassing electrical; thermal; and thermo-fluid models. Object-Oriented (O–O) languages such as Modelica are obviously well-suited for the modeling of such systems; however; traditional state-ofthe-art hybrid differential algebraic equation solvers cannot efficiently simulate these systems especially when their size grows to the order of hundreds; thousands; or even more interconnected units.

The goal of this paper is to show; through a couple of exemplary case studies; that Quantized State System (QSS) integration methods are ideally suited to solve models of such systems; as they scale up better than traditional methods with the system size; and provide time savings of several orders of magnitude; while achieving comparable numerical precision.}

abstract = {Offshore oil facilities are complex systems that involve elaborate physics combined with stochastic aspects related; for instance; to failure risk or price variation. Although there exist many dedicated software tools to simulate flows typically encountered in oil exploitations; there is still no tool that combines physical (mostly engineering fluid mechanics) and risk simulation. Such a tool could be useful to engineers or decision makers for specification; design and study of offshore oil facilities. We present a first step towards the creation of such a tool. Our current simulator is based on new Modelica components to simulate fluid flows and on stochastic simulation at a higher level; for modeling risk and costs. Modelica components implement physical models for single and two-phase flows in some typical devices of an offshore field. The risk simulation uses Markov chains and statistical indicators to assess performance and resilience of the system over several months or years of operation.}

The number of parameter sets that can be created are huge and an algorithm called subset selection algorithm is used to reduce the number of parameter sets. The algorithm investigates the numerical properties of a calibration from a parameter Jacobean estimated from a simulation of the model with reasonably chosen parameter values. The calibrations were performed with a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm considering the least squares of eight output signals. The parameter value with the best objective function value resulted in simulations in good compliance to the process dynamics. The subset selection algorithm effectively shows which parameters that are important and which parameters that can be left out.}

A common complement is finding the root of an algebraic function (an event function) that depends on the states of the problem.

The problem of root-finding during integration is however difficult. Both in a theoretical aspect and as a software problem.


An implementation of software for root-finding is done in Assimulo; a Python/Cython wrapper for integrators. The implementation takes the Functional Mock-up Interface standard into consideration. The implementation is made usable for a wide variety of integration algorithms and is also verified and benchmarked with advanced industrial models; showing good indications of being robust and scaling well for large systems.}

The first step aims at solving the discrete variables from the unit commitment sub-problem (UCP) using standard mixed integer linear models and optimization techniques. The second step focuses on the economic dispatch sub-problem (EDP) described by high-fidelity; continuous time; physics-based Modelica models together with nonlinear optimization techniques from the JModelica.org platform. The output of the second step includes optimized power flows but also highly relevant variables such as supply temperature; supply flow rate; turbine by-pass valve in the cogeneration plant. The optimization is formulated as a maximization of the benefit from heat and electricity sell over a finite time-horizon. 


The proposed method is validated in several test cases using experimental data from a plant in Nyköping. The optimizations demonstrate the feasibility and the high economic potential of the proposed approach when comparing with measurement data and the standard optimization techniques. The optimized planning schedules result in a balance between produced and consumed heat; priority to low-cost boilers and maximization plant revenue. Compared to measurement data; the optimizations result in a significantly lower supply temperature; a more extensive usage of the external cooler for higher efficiency and higher electricity production; fewer starts of units as well as an appropriate use of the accumulator tank.


The high-level description of optimization problems using JModelica.org provides useful means to specify flexible optimization problems including con-straints on arbitrary process variables such as heat load of the production units; supply temperature and flow rate; pressures.}

In order do be able to produce active electrical power with an asynchronous generator once needs to provide enough excitation by means of reactive power provided by either the electrical grid or additional capacitors.

But in asynchronous generators we can also find the phenomenon of self-excitation which allows the asynchronous generator to operate as a standalone unit. Investigation of the self-excitation process shows that significant over-voltages can occur if a generator with sufficient capacitors is suddenly disconnected from the utility grid. The precondition for a successive voltage build-up is that the generator is left with enough capacitive power and a low load after the disconnection.

The <em>Lønnestad</em> radial in <em>Seljord; Norway</em>; is a distribution radial with both asynchronous and synchronous generators connected. In order to investigate the system dynamics in the radial after it is disconnected from the rest of the 22<em>k</em>V distribution grid; the radial was modelled and simulated using Modelica as modelling language.}

Compared to traditional energy systems; HES provide additional operational flexibility so that high variability in both energy production and consumption levels can be absorbed more effectively. This is particularly important when including renewable energy sources; whose output levels are inherently variable; determined by nature.

The specific HES configuration modeled in this paper include two energy inputs: a nuclear plant; and a series of wind turbines. In addition; the system produces two energy outputs: electricity and synthetic fuel. The models are verified through simulations of the individual components; and the system as a whole. The simulations are performed for a  range of component sizes; operating conditions; and control schemes.}

abstract = {As part of the advanced small modular nuclear reactor (AdvSMR) R&D program; Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is developing a Dynamic System Modeling Tool (MoDSim) to facilitate research and development related primarily to instrumentation and controls (I&C) studies of small modular reactors (SMRs). 


The primary objective is to produce a demonstration product of a dynamic system modeling tool for SMRs. Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) has been used to allow the development of scoping models for non-Modelica users.  This tool includes a web-based interface using Xogeny’s FMQ platform for model configuration with local application deployment for simulation using FMI Add-in for Excel from Modelon; this toolchain is designed to allow plug and play access for users of various skill levels.  The  web-based interface allows true web-based access and solutions without requiring local applications. The initial installation of this tool has been tested on a liquid-metal small modular reactor (ALMR) concept modeled using Dymola and exported via FMI. This tool allows simulation to be performed within Excel without expertise in the native simulation language (Modelica) or solver (Dymola). This toolchain fulfills the Department of energy (DOE) project scope goal of developing a tool “<em>in a common and familiar environment to support a range of research activities requiring dynamic behavior simulation; modeling tools with easily re-configurable modules that reduce data input to typically available system level plant data</em>”.}

The implemented algorithm is a modification of the approach proposed in [17; 18]. The new implementation is done under the JModelica.org framework along with CasADi and Ipopt. The framework uses a symbolic pre-calculation of functions and derivatives. Besides the integration of various components of JModelica.org; Ipopt; and CasADi; the implementation facilitates simpler modeling of optimal control problems along with a choice of options for various linear algebra algorithms. The paper gives a description of the algorithm and elaborates the components of the framework. Numerical experimentations show that the new implementation is efficient in comparison with the published results of other authors.}

abstract = {Modelica is primarily supported by simulation environments for the treatment of equation based models and model libraries. As of today Modelica is rarely used for the exchange of engineering data; visualization or interactive computing; even though the Modelica language offers a lot of interesting features for such applications.


This paper investigates the potential of lightweight Modelica tools that run directly in scripting or web clients. Two Modelica parsers have been implemented
in the popular client-side languages Python and JavaScript.

The Modelica parser in Python is extended with a backend translating algorithmic Modelica definitions to Python. This gives access to existing Python
packages from scripted Modelica. It also enables the interactive debugging of algorithmic Modelica code.


The Modelica parser in JavaScript offers a generic backend interface. The paper demonstrates two applications. First a simple analysis tool for Modelica packages running from the command line is demonstrated. The true potential of JavaScript is the embedding of engineering data as Modelica code with HTML5 documents and their processing on the client side; e.g. in Web browsers. The paper shows a Modelica text editor and parameter GUI generator running in a web browser.}

To simulate the complex dynamic physical behaviour of the condenser; a dynamic model has been developed using Modelica. The component model is meant to be used for power plant modeling and simulation with the ThermoSysPro library developed by EDF and released under open source license.

The transient most unfavorable to keeping the integrity of the condenser vacuum is the loss of the cold source pumps followed by a turbine trip and a missed islanding (house load operation).

The objective is to study the evolution of the pressure of the condenser for this kind of transients. During the transiernt; the condenser pressure should be always less than 5e4 Pa.

The present paper describes in detail the condenser model: hypothesis; governing equations; correlations and the test-case (structure of the test model; the parameterization data and the results of simulation).}

Since these constraints are hard to replicate in a model; an experimental rig is an optimal solution for battery tests. Virtual engineering of a real system is advantageous in terms of the speed of modifications; the measurement of all relevant data and the low cost of development. The coupled virtual model and experimental testing rig for batteries constitute the basis for this new concept and improve the development of the electric powertrain.}

In the future; we plan to add chemistry as a sixth domain. Each domain contains connectors containing a substance-like quantity and the corresponding potential; basic models (capacitance and resistance); sensors and actuators as well as some domain specific elements; such as nonlinear accumulator; nonlinear resistors; valves; springs or inductances. In addition to the constitutive equations each model also comprises the energy balance. For example; dissipative elements calculate the loss energy and even the entropy production with the help of an additional thermodynamic connector.}

Initially; dynamics of the free roller moving in a field of gravity and having a unilateral contact constraint with horizontal surface is modeled. The contact tracking using simplified and efficient algorithm turns out being possible. On the next stage the omni wheel model is developed and debugged. After that the whole vehicle model is assembled as a container class having arrays of objects as instantiated classes / models of omni wheels and joints. Dynamical properties of the resulting model are illustrated via numerical experiments.}

This paper describes a plugin we developed for exporting Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) from Rhapsody; and the results of combining generated FMUs with continuous models. When a Rhapsody FMU is used in a different environment; some basic assumptions on its behavior are challenged. We describe the semantic mismatches between the tools; to what extent they can be overcome; and what modelers need to do in order to preserve the intended semantics of an exported FMU.}

The inverters can feed the machine models of the Modelica Standard Library: Modelica.Magnetic.FundamentalWave and the new Modelica.Magnetic.QuasiStatic.FundamentalWave.

Currently; no new language element is needed for Modelica; but a generalized semantics for State Machines has to be introduced; such as “merge semantics for differential equations“. Symbolic transformations are still handled during translation; so the generated code is efficient and there is no run-time interpreter. On the other; this feature restricts the class of multi-mode systems that can be handled.}

This property is first explained in details with the help of a simple generic test system for which a large oversampling with respect to the Nyquist frequency is required in order to keep a good level of accuracy. The linearly implicit stabilization method from Arnold is then implemented and tested thanks to the directional directives computation capability of the FMI for Co-simulation 2.0 standard.
Some minor extensions to the standard are proposed to efficiently implement the 
method. When applied to the test system; it is shown that large co-simulation steps can be taken; and hence significant computation time speed-ups are observed.}

However; slackened synchronization between the sub-models and associated solvers running in parallel introduces integration errors; which must be kept inside predefined bounds. In this paper; context-based extrapolation is investigated to improve the trade-off between integration speed-ups; needing large communication steps; and simulation precision; needing frequent updates for the models inputs. An internal combustion engine; based on FMI for model exchange; is used to assess the parallelization methodology.}

Thermal behavior; electrical behavior and the impact of the degradation due to aging are considered as they influence each other.

This paper gives an overview of the META tools and their integration with OpenModelica.

This paper presents a new approach in Modelica that allows a modeler to separate a model into different partitions for which individual solvers can be assigned. In effect; this allows to use multi-rate and multi-method time integration schemes that can contribute to improve the efficiency of a (real-time) simulation.

The first part of the paper discusses basic consideration relating to modular (real-)time integration. Afterwards; the implementation of a convenient Modelica library for the partitioning of physical models is briefly described. Finally; the presented library is used to partition a detailed six degree of freedom robot model for modular simulation. The simulation performance of that partitioned model is compared to the simulation performance achieved by using “conventional” global solvers.}

In many cases; a single vehicle; today; contains more than one assistance system; while the trend to use ADAS continues to grow.

From an overall perspective; it must be assured that the driver assistance systems – individually as well as in the way they interact – function flawlessly in any driving situation and with any driver at the wheel anywhere in the world. This results in an increased development and testing effort for modern ADAS in general. In-development testing based on virtual test driving offers an approach to a solution that allows the validation effort to be significantly reduced while meeting the requirements for safety-relevant functions in the vehicle associated with ISO 26262. This is particularly evident when developing and testing new light functions; which in real-world road tests can often be performed only in conditions of darkness. Dynamic Light Functions are defined as the situation-dependent headlight adjustment consisting of cornering light; headlight leveling and (non-blinding) headlight assistance. This paper pre-sents this new methodology.}

Using instance modifiers as well as an inner-outer broadcasting method; the faults can be triggered in a central block. Furthermore; care was taken so that the simulation of the models in a fault-free condition can be guaranteed.
A library using the proposed standard was developed. In this library; the fault implementation as well as the triggering of these faults was modeled with the end user in mind. An example implementation is presented which shows the capabilities of the library.}

The fault augmented models are automatically generated through a process developed as part of our Fault Augmented Model Extension (FAME) work. Fault diagnosis using a Bayesian approach is based on computing a set of probability density functions; a process that is usually intractable for any reasonably complex system.We use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to bound the numerical and computational complexity. The basic idea is to use fault augmented Modelica models to create probability distributions of possible outcomes and then compare those distributions against actual observations to perform parameter estimation. The detection of faults is treated as a model selection problem and the inference of their severity levels is treated as parameter estimation. The diagnostic precision of this approach is evaluated on a Modelica vehicle drive line model.}

The verification and validation procedure for functional safety of machinery is thoroughly discussed in ISO 13849-2. Following this procedure; the system behavior in case of a component failure has to be analyzed. Up to now this analysis bases on expert knowledge and real experiments. In this contribution a simulation based approach is presented. This approach has several advantages over the state-of-the-art. First; real experiments are more time consuming and costly than simulation. Moreover; according models can be used for further investigations like optimizing the sensor setup.

To enable failure simulation as a substitute of testing on real machinery for validation of functional safety; typical hydraulic failures are added to safety-related components of an in-house Modelica hydraulics library. This library is then used for the verification and validation of functional safety of a hydraulic test bench. Moreover; error propagation is considered.}

Therefore a modeling environment that is dedicated to railway vehicle dynamics such as the new DLR RaiwayDynamics Library relies on an efficient representation of the kinematics and forces or torques; respectively; that appear at the wheel-rail interface. A number of different formulations have been developed since the underlying rolling contact problem was firstly discussed in literature in 1876. The paper overviews these wheel-rail contact formulations and then presents the implemented variants in detail. The DLR RailwayDynamics Library is used to model and simulate the behavior of an experimental scaled M 1:5 running gear operating on the DLR roller rig. The simulations results are compared and validated with measurements.}

Steady exponential material growth with no limits on resource consumption and population is the dominant conceptual model used by today’s decision makers. This is an approximation of reality that is no longer accurate and started to break down. The World3 model; originally developed in 1970s; includes many rather detailed aspects of human society and its interaction with a resource-limited planet. However; World3 is a rather complex model. Therefore it is valuable for pedagogical reasons to show how similar behavior can be also realized with models that are much simpler. This paper presents a series of world models; starting with very simple exponential growth and predator-prey systems; then investigates a minimal human-nature model; Handy; and ends with a brief account of the World3 model. For the first time; a simple human-nature interaction model is made available in Modelica that distinguishes between dynamics of Elite and Commoner social groups. It is shown that Handy can reproduce rather complex behavior with a very simple model structure; as compared to that of world models like World3.}

The need to explore the potential of new fluids in different systems requires dynamic simulations for longer periods of time. In this paper; development of a medium model for propane is discussed. Besides being fast and accurate; the propane model should also be stable in different dynamic simulation scenarios. 

First; existing libraries are tested and in some cases modified to increase the stability. Since the simulation speeds were not in an acceptable range in the existing models; a new propane model is introduced. The new model is then tested as a refrigerant in a direct exchange heat pump system. A comparison between an existing propane model and the new model shows that much faster simulations; up to 35 times; are possible with the new propane model.}

On the other hand; to cope with reduced stability against external disturbances such as side wind because of the light weight; it was clarified that additional control of direct yaw moment is effective.

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole; by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently; a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) for a variety of dynamics simulation packages; particularly in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs); we propose; in this paper; to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.}

It facilitates describing one- and two-dimensional CA in Modelica; and interfacing these CA models with other Modelica models. Simulation performance and large model support have been highest priority in the design of the library. To achieve these goals; the CA internal description is programmed in C and it is consequently hidden to the modeling environment; which is released from the burden of causalizing and manipulating the millions of equations that typically compose CA models. The library architecture and use are discussed in this manuscript. Two examples illustrate the library use: heat diffusion on a chip and spread of an epidemic disease.

The DOML implementation is; actually; heavily based on the (open source) compiler of Optimica but it provides a number of important features absent in its precursor.
One main extension of the compiler lies in its built-in mechanism supporting the use of many different optimization solvers (selected on the fly; depending on the content of the problem definition) and to seamlessly add new; external; solvers.
In result; the range of problems that may be specified with DOML and solved in the IDOS environment is quite wide and keeps growing. The scope of problems ranges from some static optimization problems through regular ODE; parametric optimization; minimum time problems; up to DAE with higher index. DOML language extensions also provide preliminary support for multi-objective optimization and PDE problems.}

In general; the model equations can be of higher index; i.e.; they can contain <em>hidden constraints</em> which lead to instabilities and order reductions in the numerical integration. Therefore; a regularization or remodeling of the model equations is required. One way to obtain the required information on the hidden constraints is a structural analysis based on the sparsity pattern of the system. For the determination of a regular index-reduced system formulation then; usually; a crucial step is the so-called <em>state selection</em>. In this paper; we will present a new approach for the remodeling of dynamical systems that uses the information obtained from the structural analysis to construct a regularized overdetermined system formulation. This overdetermined system can then be solved using specially adapted numerical integrators; in such a way that the state selection can be performed within the numerical integrator during runtime of the simulation.}

In the ideal case; the same model can be used throughout the whole development process from concept and design over implementation to system verification. The idea is to use one uniform model along this V-scheme. This leads to the requirement that simulations have to be able to run in real-time on hardware-in-the-loop platforms. On the other hand; very detailed models of some components might be needed during the early design phase.
Thus; a trade-off between modeling depth and computational performance has to be found. This may be achieved by selectively simplifying parts of the model that are prone to generating stiff sub-systems or a large number of state events.
Within this framework; the present paper introduces the Modelica simulation model of TraXon; the new modular transmission for heavy commercial vehicles by ZF. The model can be adapted to various needs by replacing components according to the required modeling depth and/or dynamical behavior. 
After a brief overview of the ZF in-house Modelica libraries and the architecture of the TraXon model; some approaches and tools are described for evaluating and optimizing models with respect to real-time issues.}

The model can represent an articulated vehicle with an arbitrary number of units each with an arbitrary number of axles. Lateral and yaw dynamics are in focus but longitudinal effects in couplings are also included. In the model; tire forces are linear with respect to slip angle. The couplings between units are represented as non-linear kinematic constraints which are valid for small and large articulation angles.

Four use cases are presented: Inverse dynamics for feedforward control; frequency responses when varying parameters; steady-state evaluations and dynamic simulation. For these use cases; four parametrizations of the model are used corresponding to a tractor with a semitrailer a truck with a dolly and a semitrailer; an {A-double} (tractor+semitrailer+dolly+semitrailer) and an approximate version of an airport baggage carrier with five full trailers.}

In particular; the steps required to generate the model of a flexible body starting from a FEM analysis; performed with commercial packages; are detailed. Simulations results are shown with reference to a sudden braking and to a series of impacts with curbs. In this last case; an unstable behavior occurred when considering the flexible component; which is currently under investigation.}

These tools have been developed to address the gaps and limitations encountered in legacy simulation tools. These tools were originally designed for the analysis of individual domains of buildings; and have been difficult to integrate with other tools for runtime data exchange. The coupling has been realized by use of the Functional Mock-up Interface for co-simulation; which standardizes an application programming interface for simulator interoperability that has been adopted in a variety of industrial domains.

As a variety of coupling scenarios are possible; this paper provides users with guidance on what coupling may be best suited for their application. Furthermore; the paper illustrates how tools can be integrated into a building management system to support the operation of buildings. These tools may be a design model that is used for real-time performance monitoring; a fault detection and diagnostics algorithm; or a control sequence; each of which may be exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit and made available in a building control systems as an input/output block. We anticipate that this capability can contribute to bridging the observed performance gap between design and operational energy use of buildings.}

The systems are manifold; including e.g. DC; single- and multiphase AC with fixed and variable frequency. Often times such systems cover other physical domains as well; such as rotational mechanics and thermo-fluid. Required system models range from simple flow calculations of active power to detailed transient and asymmetric studies of three-phase systems. Transformed modal coordinates play an important role for the treatment of three-phase AC systems.

The paper introduces the new Modelica PowerSystems library. It covers arbitrary phase systems in one modeling framework. Besides simple generic models that are valid with all phase systems; also large sets of detailed component models for DC and threephase AC are included. The detailed component models have been ported from the former Spot library to PowerSystems.

The usefulness of the library is shown on behalf of manifold examples and applications carried out so far for power/frequency control; intraday optimization and virtual power plants as well as electrical drive trains of wind turbines.}

Within this interchangeable multi-level approach; there are two key attributes which are implemented into this new library. The first is the ability to include losses between the input and output of the Power Electronic Inverter. This is implemented so that the losses are included irrespective of the direction of power flow. Secondly; this library also provides the ability to trigger single or multiple open and short circuit faults within the Inverter. The library therefore provides an extremely useful tool able to compare system response under a variety of operational scenarios.}

The adoption of a phasor-based approach results in high simulation efficiency; but is limited to the first of the two situations above; while for the second; time domain models are required. For system studies where both situations have to be simulated; a modelling paradigm is thus required that can join the two approaches in all the described components; and by which the simulator of an entire network can be endowed with the capability of moving back and forth from a phasor to a time domain system description automatically; taking care of the proper re-initialisations when necessary. In this paper we propose a possible solution; and apply our ideas by presenting the first nucleus of a Modelica library designed along them. We also show some simulation examples to support the validity and practical convenience of the proposal.}

abstract = {To manage complexity; modern programming languages use organizational units to group code related by some common purpose. Depending on the programming language; these units might be called libraries; packages or modules. But they all attempt to encapsulate functionality to promote modular code and reusability. For the remainder of this paper; we will simply refer to these organizational units as packages (as they are called in Modelica).

Also common to many modern programming languages are tools to manage these packages. These tools are generally called package managers and they allow developers to quickly “fetch” any packages they may need for a given project. The main functions of package managers are to allow developers to search; install; update and uninstall packages with a simple command-line or graphical interface. In the Java world; the most common package manager is maven. For Python; tools like easy_install and pip are used for managing packages. For clientside web development; bower is used. For serverside JavaScript; the tool of choice is npm. For compiled languages; these package managers often include some additional build functionality as well.

This paper introduces impact; a package manager for Modelica. Using impact; Modelica users and developers can quickly search for; install and update Modelica libraries. In this paper; we will discuss the functionality provided by impact. In addition; we will discuss how the functionality was implemented. As part of this we will discuss the importance of collaborative platforms; like GitHub in our case; for providing a means for collecting; curating and distributing packages within a community of developers.

The impact package manager is provided to the Modelica community as a free; open-source tool. Furthermore; the protocols involved are all documented and we encourage tool vendors to integrate them into their own tools so they can provide the same searching; updating and installation capabilities that the command-line tool provides.}

Creation and automatic execution of tests need to be easy to be accepted by the user. Currently; testing is mostly performed manually by regression testing and investigation of result plots. Furthermore; comparisons between different tools can be cumbersome due to different output formats. In this paper; the test framework MoUnit is introduced for automatic testing of Modelica models through unit testing. MoUnit allows comparison of Modelica simulation results with reference data; where both reference data and simulation results can originate from different simulation tools and/or Modelica compilers. The presented test framework MoUnit brings the widespread approach of unit testing from software development into practice also for physical modeling. The testing strategy that is used within the Modelica IDE OneModelica from which the requirements for MoUnit arose; is introduced using an example of linear water wave models. The implementation and features of MoUnit are described and its flexibility is exhibited through two test cases. It is outlined; how MoUnit is integrated into OneModelica and how the tests can be automated within continuous build environments.}

The produced library remains with the same structure and the underlying models keep the same interface

The illustration is rather done via a compact library; the opensource ADMSL library; but rich enough to facilitate a lot of representative Modelica language constructs.

The APU comprises a PEM fuel cell and fuel processor to enable direct utilization of on-board diesel. The system is under development in FCGEN; an EU project under the FP7 program FCH JU [1]. One critical challenge is to design the control system (PLC) to ensure failsafe and environmental friendly startup and operation. The startup phase of the fuel processor is the most critical part; since it is a highly dynamic process involving several complex reactors. It is advantageous to verify the control system before the fuel processor is assembled to avoid possible breakage of components. Such verification can be done with a real-time model representing the physical system. In this study such a model is created using Modelica and Dymola. It is shown that it is possible to load and execute a real-time Modelica model capable of realistically mimicking the system response on a HIL platform. The model runs in real time using a first order explicit (Euler) solver with a time step size of 25 ms.}

We argue that the cornerstone of addressing these challenges is the definition of a semantic framework with an appropriate underlying model of time.

Using two simple examples; we illustrate the properties of such a model and explain why existing models are not sufficient. Finally; we propose a new Zeno-free semantic model that allows mixing discrete and continuous behaviour in a rigorous way and provides for the compositional behavioural abstraction.

Although it is based on non-standard analysis; we explain how our semantic model can be used to develop hybrid system simulators.}

Both versions of the model are implemented in Modelica and were simulated using Dymola as simulation environment. The DySMo framework; which supports the simulation of variable-structure models in common simulation environments; was used to facilitate the redesign.
The general benefits of the variable-structure approach are presented; and on the basis of the rocket model we present that simulation time and the data volume of the simulation can be reduced while maintaining the accuracy of the simulation results.}

abstract = {This article  proposes an efficient approach to model stochastic hybrid systems and to implement Monte Carlo simulation for such models; thus allowing the calculation of various probabilistic indicators: reliability; availability; average production; life cycle cost etc. First; we show that stochastic hybrid systems can be considered; most of the time; as Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP). Although PDMP have been long ago formalized and studied from a theoretical point of view; they are still difficult to use in real applications. The solution proposed here relies on a novel method to handle the case when the hazard rate of a transition depends on continuous variables; the use of an extension of Modelica 3.3 and on Monte Carlo simulation. We illustrate the approach with a simple example: a heating system subject to failures; for which we give the details of the modeling and some calculation results. We compare our ideas to other approaches reported in the literature.}

The library has been developed adopting a multi-level approach; in order to minimize the models complexity and reduce the computational time. Multi-level approach consists in creating several models of the same electrical machine topology; with different levels of complexity. Indeed; model complexity increases at higher model levels and each model takes into account specific physical effects. In addition to the fundamental behavior; the presented models address physical effects such as losses; magnetic saturation; torque ripple and fault conditions. The interchangeability among model levels is ensured by using common interfaces. An overview of the library structure is given; however; particular attention is paid on the permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) models; since they are becoming increasingly widespread in aerospace applications. The PMSM models description and simulation results are provided; in order to highlight the implemented physical effects and confirm the models effectiveness.}

The origin of the singularity is explained; and a rigorous physical solution is proposed to eliminate the singularity. A prototype implementation has been developed in the ThermoSysPro library for power plant modelling that illustrates the interest of the proposed solution and enables to evaluate the computing overhead with respect to several possible variants.}

A step response is calculated using a combination of a short-term response model which takes into account the transient heat transfer in the heat carrier fluid; the grout and the immediately surrounding ground; and a long-term response model which calculates the boreholes interactions. Moreover; an aggregation method is implemented to speed up the calculations. Validation shows good results and very high computational efficiency.}

In this paper a submodel of a refrigeration cycle; consisting of models for expansion valve and evaporator; is inverted. The resulting controller is tested in a model-in-the-loop environment and applied on an automotive refrigeration cycle. The advantage of a dynamic inverse model in contrast to a static one is pointed out. Also the results are compared to a standard PI controller.}

While CAD handles the geometric design and space analysis; MBS leads to a deeper understanding of the dynamic behavior of the future system. The CAD system has to provide physical and geometrical data; such as mass; inertia and connecting frames in order to improve simulation results. Automation at this point helps to create consistent simulation and design models and shortens the amount of time needed to produce realistic simu-lation results. Based on Visual Basic for Applica-tions (VBA) a method is implemented to automatically generate an isolated Modelica model package or a single Modelica model from CATIA assemblies or parts. The introduction of design controlling parameter variables in addition to the multibody data enables optimization loops between multibody simulation and the related CAD model. An example demonstrates the three main steps of the presented method; divided into model processing; package generation and parameterized package update.}

The systems to be controlled are typically described using differential-algebraic equations (DAEs); which can be conveniently formulated in Modelica. In addition; the corresponding optimization problem can be expressed using Optimica.

Solution algorithms based on collocation methods are highly suitable for discretizing the underlying dynamic model formulation. Thereafter; the corresponding discretized optimization problem can be solved; e.g. by the interior-point optimizer Ipopt. The performance of the optimizer heavily depends on the availability of derivative information for the underlying optimization problem. Typically; the gradient of the objective function; the Jacobian of the DAEs as well as the Hessian matrix of the corresponding Lagrangian formulation need to be determined. If only some or none of these derivatives are provided; usually numerical approximations are used by the optimizer internally.

OpenModelica supports the Optimica language and is capable of automatically generating the discretized optimization problem using collocation methods as well as the whole symbolic machinery available. In addition; all necessary derivative information is determined using the automatic differentiation capabilities of ADOL-C; which has now been integrated into the OpenModelica environment.}

We present a method for achieving this; which handles DAE-constrained optimization problems. The method is based on techniques commonly used in Modelica tools for simulation of DAE systems.

The method is evaluated on two industrially relevant benchmark problems. The first is about vehicletrajectory generation and the second involves startup of power plants. The problems are solved using both the DAE formulation and the ODE formulation and the performance of the two approaches is compared. The ODE formulation is shown to have roughly three times shorter execution time. We also discuss benefits and drawbacks of the two approaches.}

However the effects on the power plants regarding the addidional wear of components is uncertain. Usually the effects regarding control reserves; especially primary control occure with high frequencies and small amplitudes; which makes investigations based on measurement data impossible since the effects are masked by the noise of normal operation.
 In order to investigate this issue; a detailed model of a lignite power plant has been developed in Modelica for simulating and comparing scenarios with and without offering primary control reserves.  The model comprises the entire water-steam cycle including turbines; preheaters and pumps; as well as a very detailed boiler model including the air supply; coal mills; a combustion chamber; heating surfaces and piping. Furthermore the power plants control system has been implemented in a very precise way. In addition the study involves an investigation on the input signals (grid frequency) and a calculation of lifetime consumption for specific components to evaluate the effects.}

The complete system consists of models for incoming solar irradiation; a parabolic trough collector field; thermal storage and a simplified Rankine cycle. A parabolic trough power plant named Andasol located in Aldeire y La Calahorra; Spain is chosen as a reference system when the complete system model is designed and built in Dymola. The system model is later verified against performance numbers from this reference system in order to make sure a correct implementation has been made. Test cases with difference in solar insolation for different part of the year is set up and simulated. These tests shows that the system model works as expected but lacks some of the dynamics present in a real thermal power plant. This is due to the use of a simplified Rankine cycle. The collector and solar model is also verified against different papers regarding solar collector performance and shows good results; which indicates a correct implementation of the different loss models.}

abstract = {Modelica has proven to be a compelling technology for creating sophisticated multi-domain models. It provides modern language features to promote model reuse and maximize developer productivity. These capabilities are backed up by proven simulation performance. More recently; the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI) has created an avenue for these models to be exported outside the model development environment as Functional Mockup Units (FMUs).

In this paper; we explore one possible way to utilize models that have been exported as FMUs. Specifically; we discuss how to incorporate these models into a web-based engineering analysis application that is designed to be accessible to non-expert users. Our goal is to show the important role that web and cloud based approaches can have in magnifying the impact of modeling activities across the enterprise.

We consider a specific engineering model and discuss exactly how we have transformed the model to make it accessible as a web-based application. This includes a discussion of the input and output data associated with the model as well as how a web based deployment (backed by cloud based services) can provide unique features compared to more conventional methods of model deployment.}

abstract = {There are many different commonly used file formats for storing time series data. Most of these file formats are designed with the assumption that the file itself will be locally available to the software that will be reading or writing the data stored in them. While this assumption is an excellent one for desktop based tools with direct access to disk drives capable of moving virtually instantaneously around from sector to sector; there are a growing number of applications for which local access is not necessarily available. For these applications; we’ve initiated the recon project to develop more suitable formats.

With the emergence of web and cloud based modeling and simulation technologies; the time has come to explore file formats specifically optimized for nondesktop applications. In this paper; we present a new set of file formats that are specifically designed for web and cloud based approaches. This paper reviews the key requirements for web and cloud enabled applications and then presents a specification for two file formats that address those requirements.

When considering the various use cases that drove our requirements; we recognized that two different file formats were actually required. The first format; the wall format; is optimized for writing. The other format; the meld format; is optimized for reading over a network (i.e.; minimizing the number of reads and bytes read). We will discuss the layout of each of these formats and describe the use cases for which they are most appropriate.

In the open tradition of the Modelica Association; the authors have made specifications and implementations for these formats available as open source libraries with the hope that they will benefit the community as a whole.}

abstract = {The amount of needed initial equations in an object-oriented model can only be determined at system level. Because Modelica models are generally designed by components; it is hard to figure out all needed initial conditions at system level; even more when changes are applied to the model; e.g. by adding or removing components.  Hence; it is more convenient to define initial equations at component level. Due to component connections; algebraic dependencies between states may be introduced; which eventually lead to the removal of states when symbolic index reduction algorithms are applied. In this process the corresponding initial equations are not automatically removed and an over-determined initial system ensues.

This paper describes an algorithm that detects such redundant equations and determines if they are consistent or not. Consistent redundant initial equations can thus be removed automatically; and inconsistent ones can be reported to the modeler. The algorithm is implemented in OpenModelica; tested on several representative cases; and compared to previously presented concepts.}

The new library is intended to decouple the models that collect the equations of heat transfer phenomena from the thermo-physical properties of the matters (fluids and solids).

The NewThermal library; in the same way that the current Thermal library from MSL; is composed of thermal system components to model heat transfer and simple thermo-fluid pipe flow. Nevertheless; the models from the package proposed inherit the thermal properties from Media and Material models of the fluids and solids involved (either temperature dependent or constant). In this way; the user has three aspects to define; the heat transfer phenomena to be modelled; the geometrical characteristics of the bodies; and the matters involved.

Components inside HeatTransfer package are implemented such they can be used for any material model in Materials package; in the same way that components from Modelica.Fluid were carried out for their use with media models from Modelica.Media.

The NewThermal library; in addition; provides some general base models for the modelling of 2D and 3D heat conduction in basic solid geometries.

Two examples of use for different domains are presented to illustrate the features of the new libraries.}

The authors of this article have developed a module for the OpenModelica Compiler (OMC); which creates; simplifies and schedules such task graphs. The tasks are created based on the BLT (block lower triangular)-structure; which is derived from the right hand side of the model equations. A noticeable speed-up for fluid models on modern six-core CPUs can be achieved.}

A co-simulation was developed between Dymola® and Abaqus® to simulate the power loss and ascertain the temperature behavior on the housing of the eAxle . Finally; the eAxle with a vehicle model was driven over a special realistic handling course using an open source software called Blender®. The dynamic behavior of the whole vehicle model (with eAxle) will be validated by means of an optical measurement process or what so called (Object Tracking).}

In a first attempt; a coupling using FMI was tested without success due to a lack of adequate solvers for FMI export. Therefore; a script coupling was implemented.

The aim of this tool is to enable the user to set up a geometrically correct thermal model for complex geometries that allows predicting the impact of heated/heating devices and their location both in terms of airflow pattern and radiation distribution. Using a geometry file exported from CAD software; the tool distributes wall facets; air nodes and computes the long-wave radiant view factor matrix for obstructed and unobstructed surfaces. This information is exported as ready to use Modelica code. The zonal model VEPZO is used to model airflow within a domain (enclosed space). This model allows predicting airflow and air temperature distribution in space on a coarse mesh and thus computes faster than classical CFD computations. Walls are subdivided on the same grid as the zonal model is set upon. For each wall facet; the Modelica Thermal Model Generation Tool computes the view factors to the other facets in the domain. 

Comparison of simulated results with test data and application of the Modelica Thermal Model Generation Tool for a room with radiant heating and for the cooling of an aircraft cockpit are presented in this paper.}

For improving these building models; a good trade-off between accuracy and simulation time is a major challenge. To evaluate different radiation models for thermal network building models; we compared four outdoor radiation and two indoor radiation models.

For the comparison; we set-up three test cases on a generic room and a single family dwelling and analysed surface temperatures; heat demands and simulation times. The results favoured an outdoor radiation exchange model according to the German Guideline VDI 6007 with modified parameter calculations. It includes important simplifications that lead to short computing time while keeping a sufficient accuracy. For indoor radiation exchange modelling at constant temperatures; a linear approach significantly reduces simulation time without any major accuracy losses.}

The developed machine models are fully incorporating the multi phase electric; magnetic; rotational and thermal domain. In this publication the theoretical background of the machines models; Modelica implementation details; the parametrization of the models and simulation examples are presented.}

A model predictive control framework for optimally controlling a floor heated building heated by a heat pump is proposed. The control inputs are applied to virtual building emulator model with a limited amount of measurements. State estimation is implemented using a moving horizon estimation to reinitialize the states of the controller model in every timestep. To use the moving horizon estimation; the implementation of the Modelica model is altered. A stochastic input is declared at the controller model state equations to represent the process noise (model error). The state estimation significantly improves the output matching between emulator and controller model. The JModelica optimization framework proves to be satisfactory for the limited size virtual case. Future work will be able to build on this framework to handle different models and prediction error.}

The provided classes of machine models omit all transient electrical effects; but mechanical dynamics are fully taken into account. By including the new machine models new classes of problems can be treated; enabling fast electric machine and drive simulations. Yet; all the characteristic loss effects of transient machine models are fully taken into account; where needed. Phase numbers greater than three are supported. For each machine type available in the MSL there will then exist both a fully transient and a quasi static electric machine model. 

Abstract The package structure of the quasi static fundamental wave package and the concept of implementation will be presented. All required assumptions and limitations for operating the new machine models will be presented and discussed. Deviating parameters compared to the transient machine models will be discussed and explained. Simulation examples will be presented and compared with transient simulation experiments. Possible applications for the new machine models will be outlined.}

Due to their intrinsic nature; occupant behaviour and building and its energy systems are usually represented by different modelling paradigms. The occupant behaviour is here described by agent-based modelling (ABM) whereas the building is described by a set of hybrid differential algebraic equations; typical of dynamic thermal modelling. Such different complex systems cannot be efficiently simulated in a single tool. Therefore; one solution is the tool coupling approach.

The FMI standard for co-simulation; was used to couple the SMACH occupant behaviour simulator and a building energy model built with the BuildSysPro Modelica library. Variables of interest are passed from one model to another at fixed synchronization time steps.}

abstract = {More electrically powered aircraft reveals some significant advantages such as weight decrease; reduced maintenance requirements and increased reliability and passenger comfort. However; the development of the future more-electric aircraft (MEA) systems is a very challenging task. Its complexity may be handled by a model supported design approach for the total aircraft design process. A key factor of applying model based design is dedicated modeling and simulation techniques for all design phases. The highest complexity can be seen in the systems validation and verification phase where the aircraft system is integrated from the supplier’s models.

While the capability to conveniently model complex physical systems with Modelica is generally accepted; the capability to perform large scale model integration and analysis as part of a validation and verification process remained unproven. In this paper we give evidence of Modelica/Dymola to be suitable for the virtual testing of complex energy systems in the future MEA design process. We demonstrate the modeling and the simulation results of component stand-alone tests as well as the tests of an integrated aircraft power network.}

We present  details of our rubber spring model based on the one-dimensional; non-linear rubber spring model proposed by  M. Berg. To illustrate the behavior of the friction force modelled in the latter; it is compared to a diode model for Coulomb friction similar to the one in the Modelica Standard Library.

Development and deployment of the Interactive Dynamic Optimization Server is a result of a project funded by NCBiR (National Center for Research and Development) under grant R02-0009-06. One of the outcomes of the project was a modeling language (Dynamic Optimization Modeling Language; DOML) providing a uniform format for defining dynamic optimization problems. DOML is an extension of Modelica language and hance; not only a user can specify his problem in the way he does in Modelica but also (more importantly; for the purpose of thids paper) models created in Modelica for simulation purposes can be easily transferred to DOML for solving their related optimization problems. In particular; Modelica models can be calibrated with the help of our server. The paper tries to illustrate the point in depth. It presents the workings of the server and reviews the scope of solvers implemented; focusing especially on those that can be used for calibrating Modelica models. Special attention is devoted to an algorithm using adjoint equations for evaluating sensitivities of model equations with respect to parameters and to calibrating models described by higher index DAEs.}

In this paper; a new synthesis approach for nonlinear inverse dynamic models of satellites with flexible structures is presented. For satellite configurations with unstable zero dynamics; a stable inverse model approximation is proposed which has been successfully applied to robots with flexible bodies.

This inverse modeling approach is part of the newly developed DLR Space Systems Library for objectoriented modeling and simulation of satellites and launchers in a detailed space environment. For satellites with flexible structures; the library provides models for normal simulation mode and the necessary tools to directly generate approximate inverse models.

In this paper; trajectory optimization is shown to be an important use case for inverse dynamic models. By inversion based reformulation of the trajectory optimization problem; the optimal reference motion of the control system can be determined in a reliable and efficient way.}

The objective of this paper is therefore to present such an approach to this problematic. Based on the Constraint Force Equation (CFE) methodology; two case studies to evaluate the proposed approach are considered. Results demonstrate that the approach corresponds very well with the physics behind separation. In addition; we found easiness of implementation of the method within a single environment such as Dymola; demonstrating the benefits of an integrated approach.}

abstract = {The peak power consumption of multi-axis production machinery (e.g. industrial robots) is determined by the forces during acceleration phases of continuous movements. The required high electric currents represent a cost factor in terms of the mains power supply. In this paper a new Modelica-based method is presented to save the mechanical braking energy of production machinery into a local flywheel-based energy recuperation system (ERS) for later utilization. An ERS has twofold advantages: on the one side it reduces the apparent power peaks from the mains power system. On the other side the overall energy consumption can also be reduced therewith. However; a mechanical ERS with a flywheel needs to be controlled in advance; as its internal inertia and the switched magnetic field introduce some dead time in the process. Therefore; the here presented approach uses an interdisciplinary Modelica model of the machinery to compute future power requirements prior execution of new movements. It is assumed that the machine program is known upfront in a textual form. The movement commands must be carried out with the virtual machine model first. The simulation computes the energy demand; according to which the stored amount of energy within the ERS (i.e. the angular velocity of its flywheel) must be controlled. The here computed reference angular velocity signal is put later also to the real controller; where the physical ERS is attached to as an extra motor. This paper presents the methodology along an example of a 3-axis robotic manipulator that is installed in the VDTC building of the Fraunhofer IFF; Magdeburg. This specific example has been used to validate the concept: 12% less power-consumption and 10% less power peaks were achieved during the operation.}
